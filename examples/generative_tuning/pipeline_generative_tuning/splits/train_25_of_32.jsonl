{"prompt": "\nWhat are the key points across these news articles:\n\n\nArticle: A 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on Wednesday morning, shaking buildings and sending screaming people running into the streets only eight days after the country's capital was devastated by an apocalyptic quake. \n  \n The U.S. Geological Survey said the new quake hit at 6:03 a.m. (1103 GMT) about 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of the capital of Port-au-Prince. It struck at a depth of 13.7 miles (22 kilometers) but was too far inland to generate any tidal waves in the Caribbean. \n  \n Wails of terror rose Wednesday as frightened survivors of last week's quake poured out of unstable buildings. It was not immediately possible to ascertain what additional damage the new quake may have caused. \n  \n Last week's magnitude-7 quake killed an estimated 200,000 people in Haiti, left 250,000 injured and made 1.5 million homeless. A massive international aid effort has been launched, but it is struggling with logistical problems, and many Haitians are still desperate for food and water. \n  \n Still, search-and-rescue teams have emerged from the ruins with some improbable success stories _ including the rescue of 69-year-old ardent Roman Catholic who said she prayed constantly during her week under the rubble. \n  \n Ena Zizi had been at a church meeting at the residence of Haiti's Roman Catholic archbishop when the Jan. 12 quake struck, trapping her in debris. On Tuesday, she was rescued by a Mexican disaster team. \n  \n Zizi said after the quake, she spoke back and forth with a vicar who also was trapped. But he fell silent after a few days, and she spent the rest of the time praying and waiting. \n  \n \"I talked only to my boss, God,\" she said. \"I didn't need any more humans.\" \n  \n Doctors who examined Zizi on Tuesday said she was dehydrated and had a dislocated hip and a broken leg. \n  \n Elsewhere in the capital, two women were pulled from a destroyed university building. And near midnight Tuesday, a smiling and singing 26-year-old Lozama Hotteline was carried to safety from a collapsed store in the Petionville...\n\n\nArticle:  Join Anderson Cooper live Tuesday night for the latest from Haiti. Stories of looting as well as tales of survival pour out of the country. \"AC360\" at 10 ET Tuesday. \n  \n Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the week since a 7.0-magnitude earthquake shattered this capital and jolted observers around the world, authorities have buried 70,000 bodies, about a third of the estimated final toll, officials said Tuesday. \n  \n Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that at least 72,000 bodies had been recovered, a figure that did not include the unknown number of bodies buried by families or collected by the U.N. peacekeeping mission here. \n  \n It was unclear how many of the dead had been identified prior to burial and how many of those burials occurred in mass graves. \"We know that bodies have been buried, we feel inappropriately,\" said Dr. Jon Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization. He cited lack of refrigeration as a complicating factor. \n  \n \"Despite all our efforts, situations, circumstances are such that we are disappointed in many cases on how this has been managed, beyond everybody's control,\" he said. \n  \n  \n  \n iReport: Search list of the missing and the found \n  \n PAHO, which is coordinating the health-sector response, offered a preliminary estimate of 200,000 dead. \n  \n At least 28 of them are Americans, the U.S. State Department announced Tuesday. \n  \n Despite the growing death toll, aid workers focused Tuesday on the living. The United Nations estimated that 3 million people were in need of food, water, shelter and medical assistance. \n  \n Some needed more than that -- they needed rescue. In all, 43 international rescue teams composed of 1,700 people have carried out some 90 rescues, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told reporters. \n  \n On Tuesday night, a team of New York City Fire Department and Police Department rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble of a two-story building in the capital.

The quake struck at a depth of 13.7 miles, but was thought to be too far inland for any risk of tidal waves. AP reporters on the scene said screaming survivors streamed out of what buildings were left standing from last week's 7.0 temblor. The aftershock came as the country's prime minister tells CNN that officials have recovered and buried at least 72,000 bodies from the initial devastation, though the real toll is thought to be closer to 200,000."}
