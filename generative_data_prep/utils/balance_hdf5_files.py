    """Balances all the files in hdf5_file_paths, to have the same number fo sequences (within 1).

    This is done by first calculating the average number of sequences per file,
    and the remainder of sequences. Then all the hdf5 files are iterated over,
    and if they have more than the average number of sequences, those sequences are
    removed from the hdf5 file and saved. If the hdf5 file has fewer sequences than
    the average, then we save how many more sequences the file needs. The last step
    is to iterate over all the files that need sequences, and add the sequences
    from the saved extra sequences of the other hdf5 files.

    Instead of dropping the remainder sequences, the first [remainder] files iterated
    over are granted 1 extra sequence. This means that the files are not perfectly
    balanced, but are within 1 sequence of each other.
