{"prompt": "Title: Watch for allergic reaction!\nProduct review: Like other reviewers, my son also had a terrible rash after we switched from Swaddlers to Cruisers. Our pediatrician had no idea what it was and prescribed an anti-fungal ointment and a hydrocortisone lotion. After more than a week using both, the rash just continued to get worse. We bought a package of Pampers Baby Dry just to see if a different diaper helped, and the rash cleared up within two days. I didn't really believe that it was the Cruisers diapers causing the rash since the Swaddlers and Baby Dry were fine (all Pampers brand), but when we tried using the Cruisers on him again a few weeks later (we had a ton left over) the rash came back after just a day. I did a quick search online and found lots of people have this problem. If you use these diapers, watch carefully for a rash and change to a different line of diapers right away if you see it and save your baby the pain and discomfort!\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?\n", "completion": "\nunflattering "}
