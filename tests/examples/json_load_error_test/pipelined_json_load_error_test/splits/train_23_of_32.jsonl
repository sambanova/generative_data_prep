{"prompt": "I glanced over all these rave reviews and I'm sorry I get lazy to go into detail bc it seems so redundant!  So, here's another gushing review of this place, I'll try and keep it short!\\nCame here for a lovely Valentine's dinner and..\\nIt's awesome. So far, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  \\nLove the dark decor with purple furnishings, dazzling chandeliers, glod accents, and plush cushions.  Their service was on point.  The plating was beautiful and flowed nicely.  The only thing I didn't enjoy were their fake candles.  I guess they got sick of scraping wax off the tables?\\nMy favorite is the bread cart--I'm a carb girl.  I could sit there and eat bread all day and be satisfied.  We had the 4-course dinner and we were beyond full by the time we got to dessert.  I'm not sure how people eat the 6 course or even the 16 course tastings.  I guess you'd have to skip out on the bread.\\nThe foie gras was my favorite, as usual.  It literally melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting MORE. The second favorite was the dessert cart with coffee.  I love picking and choosing and then picking more! Just like the bread cart my eyes get big and I get greedy! \\nCan't wait to come here again so I can try the 16 course tasting.  Gotta save something for next time, right?\nSo I would like to give it ", "completion": " 5 stars"}
{"prompt": "I'm an administrator on the website Quora. There are two posts, one that asks \"What is better to invest in, bitcoins, stocks or something completely different?\" and another that asks \"Who were the people of Europe before the Celtic and Indo-European people came along?\". I can merge questions if they are asking the same thing. Can I merge these two questions? ", "completion": " no"}
{"prompt": "Delicious! This is right next to my chiropractors office so I decided to stop in for lunch. I ordered a veggie sub and I was not disappointed! The bread     and veggies were very fresh. The only downfall is that it isnt close to my work in North Mesa, I would love to stop there on my lunch hour!\nSo I would like to give it ", "completion": " 5 stars"}
