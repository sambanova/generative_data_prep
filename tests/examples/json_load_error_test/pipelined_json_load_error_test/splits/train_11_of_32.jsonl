{"prompt": "Eh, this place was cool (haha no pun intended) but defintely not worth the crazy price you had to pay.  Honestly had we not had a coupon for this place, we wouldn't have gone.  The idea is really neat to make an entire bar out of ice, except that this place was just the size of a giant walk in meat locker with a tiny little bar.  Also, when we went there were literallly 2 other people in the whole place, and at some point the bartender just walked out so I couldn't order another drink if I wanted to.  I guess they make enough money elsewhere  that doesn't matter, because you can't take your phone/camera in and they charge you stupid amounts to have your picture just like you would if you rode a rollercoaster at an amusement park. \\n\\nTip- DONT PAY FULL PRICE AT THIS PLACE!! there are coupons floating around everywhere and I'm pretty sure we got in using a buy one get one. ALSO the girls were handing out free shot coupons before we went in.  Definitely take advantage of this!\\n\\nIt was an experience, not sure I'd go back... unless for something crazy like a bachellorette bikini party in the ice bar (theres all sorts of pics of people doing/wearing crazy things in there).  Otherwise, take mine and most of the other reviewers' advice and know what you're getting into when you decide to come to this place.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is ", "completion": " 2 stars"}
