{"prompt": "Review: My husband and I ate at Inka Fest Peruvian Restaurant tonight.  The place has only been open since December 2010, but they have the menu down pat.

My husband had Arroz con Mariscos, a paella that was chock full of a variety of seafood.  We topped dinner off with Peruvian ice cream.\\n\\nThe prices are extremely reasonable (my fish dish was $9.95) and the wait staff very pleasant and accomodating.
