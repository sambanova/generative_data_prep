{"prompt": "", "completion": "Sony\u2019s first 3D TV is finally here, in the 40in shape of the KDL-40HX803. And to be honest, we\u2019re not expecting very much. For whenever we\u2019ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven\u2019t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let\u2019s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!\nRather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t wear Sony\u2019s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.\nIt doesn\u2019t do the 40HX803\u2018s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it\u2019s nothing like as slim as Samsung\u2019s edge LED icons. What\u2019s more, its edge LED system is a dynamic one, meaning that sections of the edge lighting can be independently controlled for a hopefully more impressive contrast performance than you usually get with a standard edge LED-lit LCD TV.\nSlightly surprisingly for such a slim screen, Sony has left most of its connections facing straight out of the TV\u2019s rear, rather than using the side access approach that would suit wall hanging. But at least the number and variety of these connections is pretty prodigious.\nFor instance, it has four HDMIs, all built to the v1.4 specification, so that they\u2019re compatible with 3D sources. Also of note are a USB input, an Ethernet port, and a 3D Sync terminal, which we\u2019ll look at in turn.\nThe USB can play music, video and photo files directly into the TV, but also allows you to add Wi-Fi to the 40HX803 via an optional USB dongle. It\u2019s a touch disappointing that the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t carry built-in Wi-Fi for its money, but it\u2019s hardly alone in preferring the optional upgrade route.\nThe Ethernet socket, meanwhile, has three uses. First, it supports the set\u2019s built-in Freeview HD tuner, to deliver potential future interactive services like the BBC iPlayer. Second, it provides a wired means of importing files stored on a DLNA PC. Finally, it allows you to take the TV online to experience Sony\u2019s Bravia Internet Video platform, which we\u2019ll return to in a minute.\nBut first we\u2019ve got to discuss the 3D Sync terminal. This is there because the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have a built-in 3D transmitter, unlike the Samsung and Panasonic 3D TVs we\u2019ve tested. In fact, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have 3D facilities at all in its standard form. You have to add an optional extra transmitter and optional pairs of active shutter glasses, with the transmitter costing \u00a350 and the glasses setting you back \u00a399 per pair. This effectively makes the 40HX803 \u00a31,887 if you want 3D with two pairs of glasses.\nWe do understand Sony\u2019s idea with this, to be fair. For it helps keep the 40HX803\u2019s up-front price down, allowing people to add 3D later as their finances allow. But there\u2019s no getting round the fact that once you\u2019ve 3Ded it up, the 40HX803 hits a similar price level to Samsung\u2019s 40C8000 integrated 3D TV. In other words, 3D continues to be very much a premium technology."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "I admit I never thought I\u2019d do any analytical work on Resident Evil 4. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s one of my favorite games. Being extremely fun to play, and a having a wonderfully creepy aesthetic are just a few of the game\u2019s strengths. But it\u2019s a silly game in a lot of ways. There aren\u2019t larger messages and meanings to glean from it. And at some moments, the game mechanics and the overall story don\u2019t match up very well. I\u2019d like to discuss one of those moments: Luis\u2019s famous death in castle. I\u2019ll use this example to discuss the elements of motivation and capacity in video games.\nYou may recall from my previous article a discussion of a player\u2019s motivation and capacity while playing a video game. Although I mentioned these terms, I never adequately defined them, so I\u2019ll do so now. A player\u2019s motivation is the reason he or she cares about playing the game and effecting some kind of difference in the world and story in which he or she is immersed. This element is present in other mediums\u2014it\u2019s the reason we continue to read/watch the story. A player\u2019s capacity, unlike motivation, is intrinsically tied to game mechanics; it consists of the things that the player is able to do in the game world. The analogue of capacity in other media is simply the reader\u2019s ability to continue to watch or read the story. There are further complexities in games, however, including that a player\u2019s degree of capacity can effect his or her motivation, but that is a discussion for another time (probably focusing on Deus Ex). For now, recall my claim that in order for a game to be truly impactful, both of these elements must exist (or noticeably not exist, as I\u2019ll discuss in my next article). Note also that the capacity element is harder and more important to make present, since it\u2019s the element that video games have introduced to storytelling.\nSo let\u2019s see whether both motivation and capacity exist in the case of Luis\u2019s death. For those who haven\u2019t played the game, you can watch a video of the moment below.\nI\u2019ll summarize the scene: Luis was attempting to help you get a \u201csample\u201d of great value from the game\u2019s primary villain, Saddler. But Saddler kills Luis, taking back the sample (classic). As Luis lies dying before you, he gives you a temporary antidote to the parasite that you are infected with, and tells you to stop Saddler. When he finally passes away, Leon yells out him name in anguish.\nSo this moment most certainly provides the player with motivation. And there are multiple reasons for this. In his final moments, Luis literally gives the player the primary plot incentive for the remainder of the game: stop Saddler and get the sample back. On top of that, finding out that Leon isn\u2019t doomed to die at the hands of his parasite energies the player with a new sense of hope. But, most importantly, the player\u2019s motivation is an extension of Leon\u2019s grief. If the player empathizes with Leon (hopefully they do if they\u2019ve gotten this far in the game), when Leon cries out in agony over the death of his friend, the player, too, is motivated seek justice for a lost friend. This is the opposite of Link\u2019s silence that I discussed in my last article. Unlike Link, who leaves you to form your experience for yourself, Leon hands you his grief, and in this way motivates you to action. This is good storytelling. Clearly Resident Evil 4 has nailed the motivational aspect of making a powerful narrative in a game. But at this point there\u2019s no particular reason story-wise to play the game instead of just watching it.\nSo let\u2019s think about capacity. Capacity is the additional element that makes a video game unique as opposed to movies or books. And the extent of what video games can do with capacity hasn\u2019t been fully explored. So, even though it\u2019s not necessary for a game to use dynamics of capacity in order to tell a good story, ignoring this element is missing an opportunity for better storytelling. Since capacity is unique to games, if there\u2019s no interesting storytelling or fun mechanics, there\u2019s no reason to play the game instead of just watch it.\nNow, in order to discuss capacity in the case of death, capacity takes on a slight nuance. When a character dies in a game, the key aspect of capacity is actually the change in capacity. It doesn\u2019t matter so much what the capacity level is in general, it just matters if there is a difference before and after a character\u2019s death. This provides meaning for the death within the structure of the game mechanics. For example, if a character dies in a game but is immediately replaced by an almost identical analogue, their death has little visceral impact for the player, who can\u2019t feel the impact of the character\u2019s death on the gameplay. This actually does happen: in Legend of The Dragoon, when one of your party members, Lavitz, dies, Albert, who literally takes on the stats of Lavitz, almost immediately replaces him. Even more notably, Cait Sith dies in Final Fantasy VII, but is quite literally replaced by an entirely identical avatar called \u201cCait Sith 2\u201d. In these situations the player\u2019s capacity has not changed, and thus the deaths have lost some of their potential narrative impact.\nThat\u2019s kind of what it feels like when Luis dies in Resident Evil 4. Although he helps you out as a non-player character (NPC) at various points in the game, it\u2019s not as though he\u2019s the only character who does this. And there\u2019s nothing to distinguish him mechanics-wise from the other characters you meet and team up with. What\u2019s more, you continue to have access to other NPCs you can get help from after he dies. So, in terms of how it feels to play the game, you don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s gone. As far as the player\u2019s capacity to team up with others in order to stay alive, very little changes after Luis\u2019s death. The player\u2019s capacity thus changes very little when he dies, and though the player grieves with Leon, it\u2019s difficult to feel a real sense of loss.\nTo sum up, although the story of Luis\u2019s death in Resident Evil is well told in terms of movies and books, the developers missed the opportunity to tell this story through the game mechanics in terms of a change in player capacity. Luis was not a unique character mechanically, and other characters that Leon meets effectively replace his avatar. The death is meaningful to watch, but far less meaningful to play.\nNathan Randall is a Master\u2019s candidate in game design at FIEA.

The memorial was designed by a Danish sculptor named Carl Rohl-Smith. It was dedicated on Oct. 15, 1903.\nThe northwest soldier is an infantryman, holding his rifle by the barrel, with the butt resting on the ground. The southwest soldier is an engineer, holding his rifle in the same position. He also carries a cylinder or tube, about 3 feet long. Perhaps it contains surveying instruments. The southeast soldier is a cavalryman, with sword pointed upward across his left shoulder. At the northeast is an artilleryman \u2014 whose hands close upon empty air.\nWhen I saw the northeast soldier, the question arose: Is he missing a rifle or a sword? Well, what would one of my heroes, Sherlock Holmes, do? Look for a cartridge box, or a scabbard.\nThere was a scabbard there, an empty one. So it was indeed a missing sword \u2014 a fact later verified in The Post\u2019s Oct. 16, 1903, edition, which included a drawing showing the soldier with a sword, its point touching the ground.\nThe lost sword is probably rusting in somebody\u2019s attic or slowly corroding in a landfill.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Charles Dickens gave us so much. Including this.\nIn A Christmas Carol,when Ebenezer Scrooge is presented with the Ghost of Christmas Present, he finds the \"jolly Giant\" sitting in state on an enormous heap of roast meats and other traditional English Christmas delicacies and flanked by \"seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.\"\nCharles Dickens knew all about delicious steam.\nHe was a committed English traditionalist in his drinking. He didn't drink the international celebrity's customary champagne, champagne, and more champagne or the trendy drinks of his day \u2014 gin cocktails, claret cups, brandy smashes, or the like. Rather, his greatest affinity was for a drink that was fading faster and faster into the past by the time he came into fame. From 1700 to 1830, give or take a couple years on each end, the preeminent English social drink was the bowl of punch, a large-bore mixture of spirits (usually rum and cognac), citrus juice, sugar, water, and spice that was guaranteed to unite any gathering in jollity and boozy good cheer. But with the industrialization, commercialization, and urbanization of day-to-day life that the Victorian years brought, the convivial ritual of clustering around the flowing bowl became as quaint and outmoded as the tricorn hat.\nDickens, however, not only bucked the trend but made a whole performance out of bucking it. When he was among friends, it was his custom to brew up a bowl of punch, complete with a running disquisition on the techniques he was using and the ingredients he was deploying, thus adding instruction to delight (as one of his characters might say). Fortunately, in 1847, he wrote the whole procedure out for a friend's wife. It's not hard to follow, and there's no better way to get a holiday party started than by getting everybody involved in draining a bowl of punch. All it takes is a little preparation in advance, a willingness to hold forth a bit in front of your guests, and a high enough ceiling that you won't burn your house down. Dickens was never afraid to employ cheap sensationalism if it would help him get over, and there's nothing more sensational for selling a drink than setting it on fire. Here's our interpretation.\nStep 1: Three hours before your party, peel 3 lemons with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, trying to end up with three long spirals of peel. Put them in a 3- or 4-quart fireproof bowl with 3/4 cup demerara sugar or other raw sugar. Muddle the peels and the sugar together and let sit.\nTalking Points: One of the secrets of punch making is to use the fragrant, sweet oil that resides in lemon peels as the sugar extract. The resulting sugar-oil mix (\"oleo-saccharum\") adds body to the punch.\nTalking Points: The cognac is for body and smoothness, the strong rum for bouquet and (frankly) flammability, and the other rum for taming the strong one.\nStep 3: Set 1 quart water to boil and put the bowl containing the lemon peels and sugar on a wooden cutting board or other heat-resistant surface in a spot where everyone can gather around. When the water boils, turn it off, gather your guests around the bowl, and pour in the cognac and rum, noting what you're adding and why.\nStep 4: With a long-handled barspoon, remove a spoonful of the rum-cognac mixture and set it on fire. Return it to the bowl, using it to ignite the rest.\nStir with a ladle or long-handled spoon, attempting to dissolve the sugar. Let burn for 2 or 3 minutes, occasionally lifting one of the lemon peels up so people can admire the flames running down it.\nTalking Points: You're setting the punch alight not because it looks cool but to burn off some of the more volatile elements of the alcohol. That's the story, anyway.\nStep 6: Grate fresh nutmeg over the top and ladle out in 3-oz servings.\nEsquire participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites."}

I also truncated all of the phrases in the bridge--all of them 3 bars instead of four--just to add to the urgency of the concept sung there. One of the things I think is most fun, though, about this tune is that the chords in the second verse are quite different than in the first even though the melody is identical... capped off with a 2sus chord replacing the typical 5 in the first verse.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "In her firstbook Stay Hungry Stay Foolish Rashmi Bansal profiled twenty five entrepreneurs who were alumni of IIM \u2013 Ahmedabad. Many had then wondered including yours truly, how important an MBA degree is to become an entrepreneur. Rashmi claims this inspired her to write Connect The Dots, story of twenty one entrepreneurs but who dont have an MBA degree. The format of the book is same as her last book. There are twenty chapters, one on each entrepreneur (Gaurav Rathore & Saurabh Vyas who co founded PoliticalEDGE are covered in one chapter) and the entire chapter is based on one single interview.\nThe book is divided in three sections : Jugaad, Junoon & Zubaan. Jugaadis are those who didn\u2019t get any formal training in business but learned by observing, experimenting and applying their mind. It includes some one like Kunwer Sachdev of Su-Kam who created a Rs 500 crore company from scratch; Ganesh Ram, who started what is today India\u2019s largest English training academy, VETA when there were no BPOs and no one knew that English coaching would be as big a market as it is now.\nJunoonis as the name suggests, are passionate about something that is ahead of its time. This was my favorite section in the book. Gaurav Rathore and Saurabh Vyas envisioned a consulting and research firm exclusively for politics and founded PoliticalEDGE; Satyajit Singh, founder of Shakti Sudha not only created a new industry but also benefited thousands of farmers in rural Bihar; Chetan Maini, founder of Reva, designed a solar car and has been producing electric cars since the time when global warming was not so well known and creating electric cars seemed to make little sense.\nThe third section Zubaan is about creative people like Paresh Mokashi, creator of Harishchandrachi Factory, India\u2019s official entry to Oscar last year or Krishna Reddy, whose Prince Dance Group, consisting of daily wage laborers won India\u2019s Got Talent last year.\nI had great hopes from the book as I loved Stay Hungry Stay Foolish. The first chapter on Prem Ganpathy is literally a rags to riches story of someone who came to Mumbai with no money and now owns Dosa Plaza, a fast food chain with 26 outlets in the country.The rest of the stories too are very encouraging. The book is replete with inspiring anecdotes and quotes . When I read the synopsis on the third section i.e. Zubaan, I thought it would be probably the weak link in this book as stories on creatives who had made it big in the field of art would be a misfit in this book about entrepreneurs. However, all these artists achieved commercial success by following their passion and this justifies their inclusion in this book about Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship after all is about following your heart.\nGenerally when the first book is good and successful authors fail to recreate the magic in their subsequent books and that too in the same genre, as people have high expectations. In this case Rashmi Bansal definitely exceeded my expectations. A very good book and must read for some one aspires to be an entrepreneur."}

How she used to walk in these magnificent gardens, trying to understand her Lord's moods and actions. It felt like a lifetime ago. As if to remind herself that she was in a different place now, that those days were over, Gabrielle reached for her Lord and interlaced her arm with the Conqueror's.\n\"They are all waiting for us in the Great Hall,\" Gabrielle said.\n\"Let them wait,\" the Conqueror smiled and looked at her Queen, while pressing a gentle hand over the pregnant Queen's back for support.\n\"There is one thing that isn't clear to me, why didn't Lady Messalina wait until after nightfall to tell me about the girl?\"\n\"Whoever set this entire subterfuge didn't take two things into account.

I wasn't sure whether I could trust him or not, and I wasn't about to march blindly into a trap on the 'say so' of an informant I knew nothing about. First, I sent a scout to check the area and to confirm that Perous was indeed there and that he was alone. That took time,\" explained the Conqueror.\n\"That I would return from Cyra alone and leave my forces behind\u2026 My desire to see you was too great. I couldn't wait.\"\nThe Queen rose to stand on her toes and placed a warm heartfelt kiss on the Conqueror's jaw, the highest place she could reach.\n\"You know, my Lady, you are the Realm's Sovereign.\"\n\"I know, my Lord,\" the Queen said and wondered why her Lord chose this time to remind her of that fact.\n\"And Lady Messalina is one of your ladies in waiting. She is your responsibility,\" the Conqueror said.\nThe reason for the Conqueror's words began to become apparent and clear to her. \"I assume treason is punishable by death, my Lord?\"\nAs they were nearing the gates of the palace, the Queen turned to the Conqueror, \"My Lord?\"\n\"Death is the most sever penalty for treason, is it not?\" the Queen asked.\nThe Conqueror smiled for she understood the meaning and the reason for the Queen's question.\n\"The Lord Conqueror and her Majesty the Queen,\" the ceremony master announced as the Conqueror and the Queen entered the Great Hall.\nAs the Conqueror and the Queen made their way to their thrones, all present in the Great Hall bowed before them until they reached their destination and seated themselves.\n\"Noblemen and Ladies of the Realm,\" the Conqueror exclaimed, \"We have summoned you all here due to a grave matter which has come to our attention and requires further investigation.\"\nThe noblemen and the ladies of the Realm began to look at one another agitatedly to see if anyone had any idea as to what the Conqueror was referring to.\n\"Lady Messalina,\" the Queen called.\nLady Messalina approached the thrones. \"Your Majesties,\" she said and bowed before them.\nAs she stood before them, the Conqueror leaned over and whispered something in the Queen's ear.\n\"Lady Messalina, is it not true that just before noon on the day of my Lord's return from Cyra, you informed me that a young lass had been seen entering the Imperial tent?\"\nLady Messalina's blood drained from her face and she grew as pale as a sheet. \"It is true, your Majesty,\" she admitted.\n\"And how did you come by this bit of information?\" the Queen inquired further.\n\"I\u2026 I can't remember, your Majesty,\" replied the nervous lady.\n\"Is it not true, that the lass in question is your very own daughter?\"\nLady Messalina nearly fainted. The crowd around her gasped in surprise and walked backwards away from her, as if trying to disassociate themselves from her.\n\"It is, your Majesty.\" At this stage, lady Messalina had already realized there was no point in lying.\n\"Was it not your intention to cause dispute between my Lord and myself?\"\nLady Messalina threw herself at the Queen's feet and began kissing them.\n\"You will stand up,\" the Queen ordered and her assertiveness gave pause to her subjects.\nLady Messalina rose back to her feet.\n\"You will answer the question.\"\n\"I will your Majesty,\" Lady Messalina replied.\n\"Did you act on your own volition?\"\n\"Who put you up to this?\" asked the Queen.\n\"Please, your gracious Majesty, I beg you please don't make me\u2026\"\n\"Nobleman Verosus and Nobleman Marton!\" the Conqueror exclaimed.\nBoth men made their way through the crowd, mortified, joined their accomplice and bowed before the thrones.\n\"What have you got to say for yourselves?\" the Conqueror's voice was ominous.\n\"Indeed not, but when her Majesty the Queen asked the question, Lady Messalina threw a glance at the two of you,\" said the Conqueror. \"That confirmed my suspicions.\"\nNoblemen Marton and Verosus confessed to the specifics of their scheme for all to hear by orders of the Conqueror, without trying to cast responsibility at one another and minimizing their own involvement in the traitorous conspiracy.\n\"Is my Lady prepared to render her verdict in the matter of Lady Messalina?\" the Conqueror asked.\n\"I am, my Lord,\" the Queen replied.\n\"Lady Messalina, you have handled yourself poorly and reprehensibly. Being a Queen's lady in waiting is a sacred duty. It has been proven to my satisfaction that you have betrayed that duty and my trust. You have been disloyal to me and disloyal to my Lord and to the Realm. You've tried by despicable means to come between my Lord and myself. This offense I cannot and will not pardon. However, I am satisfied that there are mitigating circumstances since you were extorted. Desperation deprives some of rational thought and behooves them to take desperate measures. Therefore, it is my verdict that you should be stripped of your station and be banished from the Realm forthwith for my Lord's pleasure.\" The Queen voice was steady, firm and confident.\n\"Noblemen Marton and Verosus, greed and malice are no defense against treason. Your actions solicited, financed and facilitated an act of rebellion against us and against this Realm, which resulted in the death of several subjects and warriors of the Realm. Moreover, you have extorted her Majesty the Queen's lady in waiting and exploited her innocent daughter. You and your families will be stripped of your station and possessions. Marton and Verosus, you shall suffer a quick death in three days time. As for Macedonia , I hereby appoint Lila of Potidaea as the new governor to Macedonia and a Lady of this Realm. As for Philippi, I hereby appoint her Majesty the Queen's lady in waiting, Satrina, as the new governor to Philippi, if it pleases you, your Majesty,\" the Conqueror asked the Queen.\n\"It does, my gracious Lord,\" smiled the Queen.\nAs the guards came to remove the condemned men from the Great Hall, Lady Satrina scurried to bow before the Conqueror and the Queen.\n\"Your Majesties, I cannot thank you enough for your infinite kindness, honor and generosity your Majesties have shown me, and I am grateful with all my heart and soul for the great trust you place in me, but I pray you, if I may,\" she said and her excitement was evident in her voice.\n\"You may,\" granted the Queen.\n\"With your Majesties' permission, and if it pleases you, I wish to remain in her Majesty the Queen's presence and service for I am so very contented and happy with my life here in the palace,\" she said. \"I could not have hoped to serve a kinder, nobler Sovereign than our benevolent Queen.\"\nThe Queen glanced over at the Conqueror with questioning eyes and the Conqueror, who was the one who first granted the honor, nodded her consent. Their subjects could not help but notice the silent exchange between them.\n\"As you wish, Lady Satrina and thank you,\" the Queen said and did her best to remain formal and regal and not let her own excitement be known in the forum.\n\"Captain Cornelius of the Imperial Guard,\" announced the ceremony master.\nThe Queen wasn't familiar with the name.\nWith wide determined strides, fitting a military man, Captain Cornelius approached the thrones and bowed before his Rulers.\nIt was then that the Queen recognized whom he was and fought an urge to move uncomfortably on her throne.\n\"With your permission, your Majesty,\" he humbly said and turned his attention to the Queen.\n\"I come before your gracious Majesty, a humble servant, to beg for forgiveness. In the past your Majesty showed me great kindness and granted excellent remedy, which I, I am ashamed to say, repaid with gross disrespect.\"\nHe chose this grand forum to offer his genuine remorse, rather than offer his apologies in private. In his mind, since he disrespected the Queen in the presence of the healer and others in the infirmary, it was only just that he should surrender his pride to the Queen in public.\nHe was also careful not to divulge any specifics of his transgression, including the fact that he was referring to the times back when the Queen had been a slave, so as not to cause the Queen either discomfort or embarrassment.\n\"Stand up, Captain,\" she ordered and he obeyed.\n\"Your past misdeeds towards me are pardoned,\" the Queen said, then covered her mouth and whispered a private question in her Lord's ear, to which the latter nodded her agreement.\n\"You have exhibited candor and great honor, which leads me to believe your repentance is true and sincere. I hereby appoint you a nobleman to the Realm and a governor to Philippi ,\" the Queen said.\nHe lowered his head in humility and thanked his Queen for the bounty she had bestowed upon him.\n\"That concludes our business here today, Nobleman and Ladies of the Realm,\" the Conqueror stated, stood up and offered her arm to assist her pregnant Queen to her feet.\nStanding in front of their subjects, the Conqueror went on to say, \"As I trust you all know, today I have shown great leniency towards Marton and Verosus for their appalling treachery. By no means must you perceive it as any form of a precedent. I shall see no further division in this Realm.\"\nAs the Queen and her Lord made their way out of the Great Hall, their subjects bowed before them then began clapping their hands and chanting, \" Hail to the Queen. \"\nWhilst strolling along the corridor that led to the Imperial chambers, the curious Queen asked, \"How did my Lord know that the lass in Cyra was Messalina's daughter?\"\n\"They have the same shade of hair color and the shape of their eyes and chins are exactly alike,\" the Conqueror explicated.\nAlone in the privacy of their chambers, the Conqueror turned to her Queen took her small hands in hers and said with bright eyes, \"I am so very proud of you, my Lady,\" and adorned the thin fingers with tender kisses.\nAfter three days had passed, Marton and Verosus were brought to the gallows upon a wagon, which resembled one that was fit to carry small livestock. In the square stood a large crowd, as with any execution. The Conqueror always believed that even regular people, non-warriors were fascinated by death and were curious to see life as it was leaving the body. If someone else did the actual killing, then all the better.\nHeavily guarded, the two men were escorted up the podium to face their Ruler and executioner. Verosus's neck was first to be stretched out and presented before the Conqueror.\nAs he was waiting, trembling on his knees and mumbling unintelligible words, the Conqueror unsheathed her sword, which was resting over her chiseled thigh in a leather scabbard. The polished, long and well-whetted blade caught the sun's rays.\nThe crowed cursed at the condemned men and cheered for their Sovereign, goading her on. It wasn't a novelty. The Conqueror knew that once she would lay the deadly strike, the cheers and the cursing would halt.\nWith one strike, the Conqueror put an end to his mumbling, and his severed head rolled over the floor of the podium, which was covered with sawdust to absorb the spilt blood, and his headless corpse slumped to the ground next to it.\nHis shocked expression was still frozen on his face when the Conqueror removed his head from his shoulders."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "It is done, and submitted. You can play \u201cSurvival of the Tastiest\u201d on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\nThere\u2019s a lot I\u2019d like to talk about. I\u2019ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise \u2013 something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like \u201cEvolution\u201d in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it\u2019s not evolution anymore \u2013 it\u2019s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that\u2019s not something that rubbed me the right way.\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn\u2019t want to create an \u201cintelligent design\u201d simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I\u2019d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven\u2019t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn\u2019t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the \u201cMechanical Underdogs\u201d signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist \u2013 by evolving from a normal dinner table.\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your \u201cbase\u201d. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by \u201cordering\u201d them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield\u2019s standard \u201cConquest\u201d mode).\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted \u2013 it\u2019ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working \u2013 I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It\u2019s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I\u2019d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who\u2019s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate\u2019s bill.\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it\u2019s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\nPlus, if you\u2019re zoomed out too much, you can\u2019t actually read it, so it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\nOne other solution that didn\u2019t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that\u2019s indicated by the plate\u2019s decoration \u2013 its color denotes the team owner. But it\u2019s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious \u201cCall Waiter\u201d button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team\u2019s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn\u2019t get it all done.\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta \u2013 barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn\u2019t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you\u2019d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it\u2019s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn\u2019t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That\u2019s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well \u2013 the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It\u2019s very hard for people to understand what\u2019s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\nI\u2019m extremely happy with what I\u2019ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot of what not to do.\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping \u2013 deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\nI\u2019m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you\u2019ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.
