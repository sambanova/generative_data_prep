{"prompt": "", "completion": "From the mid-1960's until the close of that decade, automobiles became lighter, more compact, and more powerful. Auto manufacturers continued to compete against one another for drag-strip supremacy. As government regulations and safety concerns increased, the muscle car era began to decline rapidly.\nMany of these ultimate high-performance muscle cars were built to satisfy homologation requirements. Others were built just to have the fastest machine on the road. The Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda is an example of one of the fiercest and most powerful vehicle ever constructed for the roadway. It was derived from the lesser Barracuda's which began in the mid-1960's. It was built atop the 'E' body platform and was restyled in 1970 by John Herlitz, making it longer, wider, and lower. The 426 cubic-inch Hemi V8 was capable of producing an astonishing 425 horsepower. Matted to a four-speed manual 833 transmission, this was the ultimate muscle car of its day.\nThis 'Cuda Convertible was given a show-quality restoration to original specifications and is one of just 374 examples originally produced for the 1971 model year. It is believed to be one of just 87 383-powered convertibles produced for the last year of 'Cuda convertible production in 1971. The 383 cubic-inch V8 has four-barrel carburetors and is capable of producing 300 horsepower. There is a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic gearbox and four-wheel hydraulic brakes.\nThe car is finished in Tawny Gold, with a white interior and a white power-operated convertible top. Features include dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets, floor console, hood pins, power brakes, power steering, Rallye wheels, a 'Slap Stik' shifter and a 'Tuff' steering wheel.\nThe 3rd generation Barracuda ran from 1970 through 1974; the previous generations were A-body Valiant based which began in 1964. Designed by John E. Herlitz on the 108-inch wheelbase, unibody, E-platform, a shorter and wider version of the existing B-body. This example has the non-Hemi 340 cubic-inch V8 with automatic and it is a stock example. 1971 was the only year for four headlamps. Somehow, this model series didn't sell to expectation and production slowed over the years, making the cars quite rare today. An unaltered car is even more rare.\nThe writing was on the wall by 1971 for the muscle car enthusiast. With rising gas prices and skyrocketing insurance rates, the days of the overpowered and often low priced performance automobile were numbered. For the big three, it seems that the decision was made to go out with a bang, and some of the rarest and most desirable muscle cars ever to come out of the Motor City were produced.\nAmong the hottest is the Hemi 'Cuda, produced for a mere two model years. In 1970, it is believed that Plymouth produced just 696 Hemi 'Cuda hardtops and for 1971, a mere 118 would leave the line.\nWild colors would survive for the 1971 model year and Chrysler would lead the pack with their Hi-Impact color palate. Several eye popping colors were offered, including Sassy Grass Green as seen on this example, which is one of the rarest offerings.\nWhen it comes to American Muscle, the Plymouth hemi 'Cuda is always at the top of the list. And when it comes to rarity and desirability, nothing compares to a 1971 Hemi ' Cuda.\nNo matter what make or model you may prefer, there is no disputing the visual impact of the 426 Street Hemi engine. With the massive valve covers and the huge dual quad carbs, it certainly takes top honors when it comes to intimidation. To add the outrageous FC7 in Violet, (aka Plum Crazy) paint to the mix is to take things a step beyond.\nThis 1971 Hemi 'Cuda exemplifies what Mopar Performance was all about in the final years of the original Muscle Car era. With a mere 107 leaving the Hamtramck, Michigan assembly plant with the Hemi engine under the shaker hood, these cars were rare even when new. This car is one of just 48 equipped with the Torqueflite automatic transmission and it also features the rare leather interior, elastomeric color keyed bumpers, power steering and power front disc brakes, a center console, the AM radio with the Dictaphone cassette recorder, tinted glass, dual color keyed mirrors and more, making it one of the highest option 1971 Hemi 'Cuda's in existence.\nOf course, when new these cars were flogged not only on the street, but at the tracks throughout the country, making this example among the most sought after and valuable American muscle cars ever built.\nThe first series of the Barracuda was produced from 1964 through 1969, distinguished by its A-body construction. From 1970 through 1974 the second series was produced using an E-body construction.\nIn 1964, Plymouth offered the Barracuda as an option of the Valiant model line, meaning it wore both the Valiant and Barracuda emblems. The base offering was a 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine that produced with 180 horsepower. An optional Commando 273 cubic-inch eight-cylinder engine was available with a four-barrel carburetor, high-compression heads and revised cams. The vehicle was outfitted with a live rear axle and semi-elliptic springs. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was introduced at the same time, separated by only two weeks, as the Ford Mustang. The Mustang proved to be the more popular car outselling the Valiant Barracuda by a ratio of 8 to 1.\nThe interior was given a floor-shifter, vinyl semi-bucket seats, and rear seating. The rear seats folded down allowing ample space for cargo.\nBy 1967, Plymouth redesigned the Barracuda and added a coupe and convertible to the model line-up. To accommodate larger engines, the engine bay was enlarged. There were multiple engine offerings that ranged in configuration and horsepower ratings. The 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder was the base engine while the 383 cubic-inch 8-cylinder was the top-of-the-line producing 280 horsepower. That was impressive, especially considering the horsepower to weight ratio. Many chose the 340 cubic-inch eight-cylinder because the 383 and Hemi were reported to make the Barracuda nose-heavy while the 340 offered optimal handling.\nIn 1968 Plymouth offered a Super Stock 426 Hemi package. The lightweight body and race-tuned Hemi were perfect for the drag racing circuit. Glass was replaced with lexan, non-essential items were removed, and lightweight seats with aluminum brackets replaced the factory bench, and were given a sticker that indicated the car was not to be driven on public highways but for supervised acceleration trials. The result was a car that could run the quarter mile in the ten-second range.\nFor 1969 a limited number of 440 Barracudas were produced, giving the vehicle a zero-to-sixty time of around 5.6 seconds.\nScottsdale, Arizona (July 18th, 2015) \u2013 Thomas Scott is an accountant and entrepreneur from Athens, Georgia who has had a love for all things automotive for as long as he can remember.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "There has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about \u2018equality\u2019 and \u2018difference\u2019: is women\u2019s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From \u2018Protection\u2019 to \u2018Equality\u2019 (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to \u2018Provision for \u201cMenstrual Leave\u201d\u2019.\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor\u2019s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue. What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "In northern Greece , in the tavern on the border between Philippi and Macedonia , Nobleman Verosus and Nobleman Marton met with Domitia, in a room they had rented. The two Noblemen could not afford being overheard or even being seen in public with the lass.\n\"I don't understand. What did you do wrong?\" the frustrated Nobleman Marton shouted at poor Domitia, who of no fault of her own found herself in this impossible and dangerous position. It was all Nobleman Marton could do not to resort to physical violence.\n\"I did exactly as I'd been told\u2026\" the young woman tried to defend herself.\nNobleman Verosus sent his fist through the wall. \"Then the Conqueror should have been all over you\u2026 in and out of you!\" he yelled and his eyebrows nearly touched together.\n\"The Conqueror wouldn't touch me,\" said Domitia.\nBoth Noblemen were still waiting for a reasonable explanation for this brilliant failure.\n\"Perhaps the Conqueror loves the Queen,\" she suggested quietly and shrugged.\nBoth men burst into laughter.\n\"Young women\u2026 All soft in the head\u2026 some of them never learn\u2026\" said Nobleman Verosus .\n\"Silly child,\" said Nobleman Marton, \"the Conqueror doesn't love. The Conqueror lusts, lusts after power, lusts after blood and lusts after women, that is all. That is the source of her power. That's what sets her ever so highly above the rest of her sex. She feels no emotions and so she isn't governed by them.\"\n\"Well, the Lord Conqueror did marry the Queen,\" argued Domitia.\nNobleman Marton turned to Nobleman Verosus and said, \"We must consider the possibility that the Conqueror didn't take this silly girl over here because she realized it was all a ploy.\"\n\"By the Gods\u2026 what shall we do? Should we run?\" Terror began to tighten its grip over Nobleman Verosus and he began fidgeting like a skittish horse.\n\"We are governors, we can't just disappear. Besides, there is no escaping the Conqueror. There is no place to hide, no place out of the Conqueror's reach. If we run now, the Conqueror will know we're guilty. Let me think\u2026\" Nobleman Marton said.\nAfter some time had elapsed in silence with both men pacing restlessly from wall to wall, Nobleman Marton continued: \"Lady Messalina won't say anything. She's neck deep in this and she has too much to lose.\"\n\"The Lord Conqueror knows nothing more than my name, and I am hardly the only Domitia in the Realm,\" she said. \"And I wore nothing that would imply my station.\"\n\"That's very good. We might just come out of it alive,\" he said.\nTwo days had gone by. The Conqueror and the Queen were taking a stroll in the Imperial gardens, near the lily pond that the Queen adored so much. As they walked together side by side, enjoying the morning sun, the odor of blossoms and the light exercise, Gabrielle recalled the days when she had been a slave. How she used to walk in these magnificent gardens, trying to understand her Lord's moods and actions. It felt like a lifetime ago. As if to remind herself that she was in a different place now, that those days were over, Gabrielle reached for her Lord and interlaced her arm with the Conqueror's.\n\"They are all waiting for us in the Great Hall,\" Gabrielle said.\n\"Let them wait,\" the Conqueror smiled and looked at her Queen, while pressing a gentle hand over the pregnant Queen's back for support.\n\"There is one thing that isn't clear to me, why didn't Lady Messalina wait until after nightfall to tell me about the girl?\"\n\"Whoever set this entire subterfuge didn't take two things into account. I wasn't familiar with the informant that disclosed Perous' whereabouts. I wasn't sure whether I could trust him or not, and I wasn't about to march blindly into a trap on the 'say so' of an informant I knew nothing about. First, I sent a scout to check the area and to confirm that Perous was indeed there and that he was alone. That took time,\" explained the Conqueror.\n\"That I would return from Cyra alone and leave my forces behind\u2026 My desire to see you was too great. I couldn't wait.\"\nThe Queen rose to stand on her toes and placed a warm heartfelt kiss on the Conqueror's jaw, the highest place she could reach.\n\"You know, my Lady, you are the Realm's Sovereign.\"\n\"I know, my Lord,\" the Queen said and wondered why her Lord chose this time to remind her of that fact.\n\"And Lady Messalina is one of your ladies in waiting. She is your responsibility,\" the Conqueror said.\nThe reason for the Conqueror's words began to become apparent and clear to her. \"I assume treason is punishable by death, my Lord?\"\nAs they were nearing the gates of the palace, the Queen turned to the Conqueror, \"My Lord?\"\n\"Death is the most sever penalty for treason, is it not?\" the Queen asked.\nThe Conqueror smiled for she understood the meaning and the reason for the Queen's question.\n\"The Lord Conqueror and her Majesty the Queen,\" the ceremony master announced as the Conqueror and the Queen entered the Great Hall.\nAs the Conqueror and the Queen made their way to their thrones, all present in the Great Hall bowed before them until they reached their destination and seated themselves.\n\"Noblemen and Ladies of the Realm,\" the Conqueror exclaimed, \"We have summoned you all here due to a grave matter which has come to our attention and requires further investigation.\"\nThe noblemen and the ladies of the Realm began to look at one another agitatedly to see if anyone had any idea as to what the Conqueror was referring to.\n\"Lady Messalina,\" the Queen called.\nLady Messalina approached the thrones. \"Your Majesties,\" she said and bowed before them.\nAs she stood before them, the Conqueror leaned over and whispered something in the Queen's ear.\n\"Lady Messalina, is it not true that just before noon on the day of my Lord's return from Cyra, you informed me that a young lass had been seen entering the Imperial tent?\"\nLady Messalina's blood drained from her face and she grew as pale as a sheet. \"It is true, your Majesty,\" she admitted.\n\"And how did you come by this bit of information?\" the Queen inquired further.\n\"I\u2026 I can't remember, your Majesty,\" replied the nervous lady.\n\"Is it not true, that the lass in question is your very own daughter?\"\nLady Messalina nearly fainted. The crowd around her gasped in surprise and walked backwards away from her, as if trying to disassociate themselves from her.\n\"It is, your Majesty.\" At this stage, lady Messalina had already realized there was no point in lying.\n\"Was it not your intention to cause dispute between my Lord and myself?\"\nLady Messalina threw herself at the Queen's feet and began kissing them.\n\"You will stand up,\" the Queen ordered and her assertiveness gave pause to her subjects.\nLady Messalina rose back to her feet.\n\"You will answer the question.\"\n\"I will your Majesty,\" Lady Messalina replied.\n\"Did you act on your own volition?\"\n\"Who put you up to this?\" asked the Queen.\n\"Please, your gracious Majesty, I beg you please don't make me\u2026\"\n\"Nobleman Verosus and Nobleman Marton!\" the Conqueror exclaimed.\nBoth men made their way through the crowd, mortified, joined their accomplice and bowed before the thrones.\n\"What have you got to say for yourselves?\" the Conqueror's voice was ominous.\n\"Indeed not, but when her Majesty the Queen asked the question, Lady Messalina threw a glance at the two of you,\" said the Conqueror. \"That confirmed my suspicions.\"\nNoblemen Marton and Verosus confessed to the specifics of their scheme for all to hear by orders of the Conqueror, without trying to cast responsibility at one another and minimizing their own involvement in the traitorous conspiracy.\n\"Is my Lady prepared to render her verdict in the matter of Lady Messalina?\" the Conqueror asked.\n\"I am, my Lord,\" the Queen replied.\n\"Lady Messalina, you have handled yourself poorly and reprehensibly. Being a Queen's lady in waiting is a sacred duty. It has been proven to my satisfaction that you have betrayed that duty and my trust. You have been disloyal to me and disloyal to my Lord and to the Realm. You've tried by despicable means to come between my Lord and myself. This offense I cannot and will not pardon. However, I am satisfied that there are mitigating circumstances since you were extorted. Desperation deprives some of rational thought and behooves them to take desperate measures. Therefore, it is my verdict that you should be stripped of your station and be banished from the Realm forthwith for my Lord's pleasure.\" The Queen voice was steady, firm and confident.\n\"Noblemen Marton and Verosus, greed and malice are no defense against treason. Your actions solicited, financed and facilitated an act of rebellion against us and against this Realm, which resulted in the death of several subjects and warriors of the Realm. Moreover, you have extorted her Majesty the Queen's lady in waiting and exploited her innocent daughter. You and your families will be stripped of your station and possessions. Marton and Verosus, you shall suffer a quick death in three days time. As for Macedonia , I hereby appoint Lila of Potidaea as the new governor to Macedonia and a Lady of this Realm. As for Philippi, I hereby appoint her Majesty the Queen's lady in waiting, Satrina, as the new governor to Philippi, if it pleases you, your Majesty,\" the Conqueror asked the Queen.\n\"It does, my gracious Lord,\" smiled the Queen.\nAs the guards came to remove the condemned men from the Great Hall, Lady Satrina scurried to bow before the Conqueror and the Queen.\n\"Your Majesties, I cannot thank you enough for your infinite kindness, honor and generosity your Majesties have shown me, and I am grateful with all my heart and soul for the great trust you place in me, but I pray you, if I may,\" she said and her excitement was evident in her voice.\n\"You may,\" granted the Queen.\n\"With your Majesties' permission, and if it pleases you, I wish to remain in her Majesty the Queen's presence and service for I am so very contented and happy with my life here in the palace,\" she said. \"I could not have hoped to serve a kinder, nobler Sovereign than our benevolent Queen.\"\nThe Queen glanced over at the Conqueror with questioning eyes and the Conqueror, who was the one who first granted the honor, nodded her consent. Their subjects could not help but notice the silent exchange between them.\n\"As you wish, Lady Satrina and thank you,\" the Queen said and did her best to remain formal and regal and not let her own excitement be known in the forum.\n\"Captain Cornelius of the Imperial Guard,\" announced the ceremony master.\nThe Queen wasn't familiar with the name.\nWith wide determined strides, fitting a military man, Captain Cornelius approached the thrones and bowed before his Rulers.\nIt was then that the Queen recognized whom he was and fought an urge to move uncomfortably on her throne.\n\"With your permission, your Majesty,\" he humbly said and turned his attention to the Queen.\n\"I come before your gracious Majesty, a humble servant, to beg for forgiveness. In the past your Majesty showed me great kindness and granted excellent remedy, which I, I am ashamed to say, repaid with gross disrespect.\"\nHe chose this grand forum to offer his genuine remorse, rather than offer his apologies in private. In his mind, since he disrespected the Queen in the presence of the healer and others in the infirmary, it was only just that he should surrender his pride to the Queen in public.\nHe was also careful not to divulge any specifics of his transgression, including the fact that he was referring to the times back when the Queen had been a slave, so as not to cause the Queen either discomfort or embarrassment.\n\"Stand up, Captain,\" she ordered and he obeyed.\n\"Your past misdeeds towards me are pardoned,\" the Queen said, then covered her mouth and whispered a private question in her Lord's ear, to which the latter nodded her agreement.\n\"You have exhibited candor and great honor, which leads me to believe your repentance is true and sincere. I hereby appoint you a nobleman to the Realm and a governor to Philippi ,\" the Queen said.\nHe lowered his head in humility and thanked his Queen for the bounty she had bestowed upon him.\n\"That concludes our business here today, Nobleman and Ladies of the Realm,\" the Conqueror stated, stood up and offered her arm to assist her pregnant Queen to her feet.\nStanding in front of their subjects, the Conqueror went on to say, \"As I trust you all know, today I have shown great leniency towards Marton and Verosus for their appalling treachery. By no means must you perceive it as any form of a precedent. I shall see no further division in this Realm.\"\nAs the Queen and her Lord made their way out of the Great Hall, their subjects bowed before them then began clapping their hands and chanting, \" Hail to the Queen. \"\nWhilst strolling along the corridor that led to the Imperial chambers, the curious Queen asked, \"How did my Lord know that the lass in Cyra was Messalina's daughter?\"\n\"They have the same shade of hair color and the shape of their eyes and chins are exactly alike,\" the Conqueror explicated.\nAlone in the privacy of their chambers, the Conqueror turned to her Queen took her small hands in hers and said with bright eyes, \"I am so very proud of you, my Lady,\" and adorned the thin fingers with tender kisses.\nAfter three days had passed, Marton and Verosus were brought to the gallows upon a wagon, which resembled one that was fit to carry small livestock. In the square stood a large crowd, as with any execution. The Conqueror always believed that even regular people, non-warriors were fascinated by death and were curious to see life as it was leaving the body. If someone else did the actual killing, then all the better.\nHeavily guarded, the two men were escorted up the podium to face their Ruler and executioner. Verosus's neck was first to be stretched out and presented before the Conqueror.\nAs he was waiting, trembling on his knees and mumbling unintelligible words, the Conqueror unsheathed her sword, which was resting over her chiseled thigh in a leather scabbard. The polished, long and well-whetted blade caught the sun's rays.\nThe crowed cursed at the condemned men and cheered for their Sovereign, goading her on. It wasn't a novelty. The Conqueror knew that once she would lay the deadly strike, the cheers and the cursing would halt.\nWith one strike, the Conqueror put an end to his mumbling, and his severed head rolled over the floor of the podium, which was covered with sawdust to absorb the spilt blood, and his headless corpse slumped to the ground next to it.\nHis shocked expression was still frozen on his face when the Conqueror removed his head from his shoulders."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Production notes for Gregg Araki's \"Doom Generation\" say it is \"Araki's first big-budget feature and marks the end of his film adolescence.\" Well, not exactly. After a promising debut with \"The Living End\" followed by the angrier, more marginalized \"Totally F***ed Up,\" Mr. Araki is still sounding a note of self-congratulatory teen-age rebellion in a film gruesome and obvious enough to make \"Natural Born Killers\" look like a model of restraint.\nIt's not even much of a change to find \"The Doom Generation\" billed as \"a heterosexual movie,\" since it shares the effective homoerotic energy of his earlier work. That this film includes a teen-age girl, Amy Blue (Rose McGowan), as part of its sexual menage only means one especially clear target of contempt (\"Don't get your uterus all tied in a knot\" is one of the more printable things anyone says to her) in a film overflowing with it. Amy's insolence and Anna Karina hairdo (like Uma Thurman's in \"Pulp Fiction\") may offer a touch of Godard. But this film's satire of teen-age-wasteland cinema is so coarsely exaggerated that any homage is beside the point.\nVoluptuous Xavier Red (Johnathon Schaech) is way ahead of charmingly dim Jordan White (James Duval) in getting the hint about this, but it doesn't matter: \"The Doom Generation\" leads them both to a gory demonstration of America's intolerance toward sexual nonconformists. Obscured by strobe lights and boosted by the alternative-rock soundtrack that's sure to help sell the movie, this already notorious castration sequence is one of several gross-out epiphanies here. Others include the severing of a head that still talks, and even vomits, after it is removed from a vein-spurting body, and a blink-of-the-eye cameo by Heidi Fleiss.\nThe genuine enthusiasm Mr. Araki brings to this film's bedroom scenes, with their whimsical sets and jokey porn ambiance, is matched by the occasionally workable black humor in his screenplay. (\"You murdered two people tonight. Doesn't that faze you at all?\" \"Yeah, I'm bummed. To the max.\") But sledgehammer direction, heavy irony and the easiest imaginable targets hardly show talent off to good advantage.\nWritten, edited and directed by Gregg Araki; director of photography, Jim Fealy; music by the Jesus and Mary Chain, Nine Inch Nails, Showdive, Curve, Meat Beat Manifesto, Pizzicato Five, Cocteau Twins and others; production designer, Therese Deprez; produced by Andrea Sperling, Mr. Araki and Why Not Productions (France); released by Trimark Pictures.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "I admit I never thought I\u2019d do any analytical work on Resident Evil 4. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s one of my favorite games. Being extremely fun to play, and a having a wonderfully creepy aesthetic are just a few of the game\u2019s strengths. But it\u2019s a silly game in a lot of ways. There aren\u2019t larger messages and meanings to glean from it. And at some moments, the game mechanics and the overall story don\u2019t match up very well. I\u2019d like to discuss one of those moments: Luis\u2019s famous death in castle. I\u2019ll use this example to discuss the elements of motivation and capacity in video games.\nYou may recall from my previous article a discussion of a player\u2019s motivation and capacity while playing a video game. Although I mentioned these terms, I never adequately defined them, so I\u2019ll do so now. A player\u2019s motivation is the reason he or she cares about playing the game and effecting some kind of difference in the world and story in which he or she is immersed. This element is present in other mediums\u2014it\u2019s the reason we continue to read/watch the story. A player\u2019s capacity, unlike motivation, is intrinsically tied to game mechanics; it consists of the things that the player is able to do in the game world. The analogue of capacity in other media is simply the reader\u2019s ability to continue to watch or read the story. There are further complexities in games, however, including that a player\u2019s degree of capacity can effect his or her motivation, but that is a discussion for another time (probably focusing on Deus Ex). For now, recall my claim that in order for a game to be truly impactful, both of these elements must exist (or noticeably not exist, as I\u2019ll discuss in my next article). Note also that the capacity element is harder and more important to make present, since it\u2019s the element that video games have introduced to storytelling.\nSo let\u2019s see whether both motivation and capacity exist in the case of Luis\u2019s death. For those who haven\u2019t played the game, you can watch a video of the moment below.\nI\u2019ll summarize the scene: Luis was attempting to help you get a \u201csample\u201d of great value from the game\u2019s primary villain, Saddler. But Saddler kills Luis, taking back the sample (classic). As Luis lies dying before you, he gives you a temporary antidote to the parasite that you are infected with, and tells you to stop Saddler. When he finally passes away, Leon yells out him name in anguish.\nSo this moment most certainly provides the player with motivation. And there are multiple reasons for this. In his final moments, Luis literally gives the player the primary plot incentive for the remainder of the game: stop Saddler and get the sample back. On top of that, finding out that Leon isn\u2019t doomed to die at the hands of his parasite energies the player with a new sense of hope. But, most importantly, the player\u2019s motivation is an extension of Leon\u2019s grief. If the player empathizes with Leon (hopefully they do if they\u2019ve gotten this far in the game), when Leon cries out in agony over the death of his friend, the player, too, is motivated seek justice for a lost friend. This is the opposite of Link\u2019s silence that I discussed in my last article. Unlike Link, who leaves you to form your experience for yourself, Leon hands you his grief, and in this way motivates you to action. This is good storytelling. Clearly Resident Evil 4 has nailed the motivational aspect of making a powerful narrative in a game. But at this point there\u2019s no particular reason story-wise to play the game instead of just watching it.\nSo let\u2019s think about capacity. Capacity is the additional element that makes a video game unique as opposed to movies or books. And the extent of what video games can do with capacity hasn\u2019t been fully explored. So, even though it\u2019s not necessary for a game to use dynamics of capacity in order to tell a good story, ignoring this element is missing an opportunity for better storytelling. Since capacity is unique to games, if there\u2019s no interesting storytelling or fun mechanics, there\u2019s no reason to play the game instead of just watch it.\nNow, in order to discuss capacity in the case of death, capacity takes on a slight nuance. When a character dies in a game, the key aspect of capacity is actually the change in capacity. It doesn\u2019t matter so much what the capacity level is in general, it just matters if there is a difference before and after a character\u2019s death. This provides meaning for the death within the structure of the game mechanics. For example, if a character dies in a game but is immediately replaced by an almost identical analogue, their death has little visceral impact for the player, who can\u2019t feel the impact of the character\u2019s death on the gameplay. This actually does happen: in Legend of The Dragoon, when one of your party members, Lavitz, dies, Albert, who literally takes on the stats of Lavitz, almost immediately replaces him. Even more notably, Cait Sith dies in Final Fantasy VII, but is quite literally replaced by an entirely identical avatar called \u201cCait Sith 2\u201d. In these situations the player\u2019s capacity has not changed, and thus the deaths have lost some of their potential narrative impact.\nThat\u2019s kind of what it feels like when Luis dies in Resident Evil 4. Although he helps you out as a non-player character (NPC) at various points in the game, it\u2019s not as though he\u2019s the only character who does this. And there\u2019s nothing to distinguish him mechanics-wise from the other characters you meet and team up with. What\u2019s more, you continue to have access to other NPCs you can get help from after he dies. So, in terms of how it feels to play the game, you don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s gone. As far as the player\u2019s capacity to team up with others in order to stay alive, very little changes after Luis\u2019s death. The player\u2019s capacity thus changes very little when he dies, and though the player grieves with Leon, it\u2019s difficult to feel a real sense of loss.\nTo sum up, although the story of Luis\u2019s death in Resident Evil is well told in terms of movies and books, the developers missed the opportunity to tell this story through the game mechanics in terms of a change in player capacity. Luis was not a unique character mechanically, and other characters that Leon meets effectively replace his avatar. The death is meaningful to watch, but far less meaningful to play.\nNathan Randall is a Master\u2019s candidate in game design at FIEA.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "It is done, and submitted. You can play \u201cSurvival of the Tastiest\u201d on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\nThere\u2019s a lot I\u2019d like to talk about. I\u2019ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise \u2013 something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like \u201cEvolution\u201d in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it\u2019s not evolution anymore \u2013 it\u2019s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that\u2019s not something that rubbed me the right way.\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn\u2019t want to create an \u201cintelligent design\u201d simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I\u2019d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven\u2019t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn\u2019t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the \u201cMechanical Underdogs\u201d signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist \u2013 by evolving from a normal dinner table.\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your \u201cbase\u201d. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by \u201cordering\u201d them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield\u2019s standard \u201cConquest\u201d mode).\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted \u2013 it\u2019ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working \u2013 I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It\u2019s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I\u2019d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who\u2019s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate\u2019s bill.\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it\u2019s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\nPlus, if you\u2019re zoomed out too much, you can\u2019t actually read it, so it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\nOne other solution that didn\u2019t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that\u2019s indicated by the plate\u2019s decoration \u2013 its color denotes the team owner. But it\u2019s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious \u201cCall Waiter\u201d button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team\u2019s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn\u2019t get it all done.\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta \u2013 barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn\u2019t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you\u2019d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it\u2019s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn\u2019t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That\u2019s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well \u2013 the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It\u2019s very hard for people to understand what\u2019s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\nI\u2019m extremely happy with what I\u2019ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot of what not to do.\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping \u2013 deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\nI\u2019m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you\u2019ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Charles Dickens gave us so much. Including this.\nIn A Christmas Carol,when Ebenezer Scrooge is presented with the Ghost of Christmas Present, he finds the \"jolly Giant\" sitting in state on an enormous heap of roast meats and other traditional English Christmas delicacies and flanked by \"seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.\"\nCharles Dickens knew all about delicious steam.\nHe was a committed English traditionalist in his drinking. He didn't drink the international celebrity's customary champagne, champagne, and more champagne or the trendy drinks of his day \u2014 gin cocktails, claret cups, brandy smashes, or the like. Rather, his greatest affinity was for a drink that was fading faster and faster into the past by the time he came into fame. From 1700 to 1830, give or take a couple years on each end, the preeminent English social drink was the bowl of punch, a large-bore mixture of spirits (usually rum and cognac), citrus juice, sugar, water, and spice that was guaranteed to unite any gathering in jollity and boozy good cheer. But with the industrialization, commercialization, and urbanization of day-to-day life that the Victorian years brought, the convivial ritual of clustering around the flowing bowl became as quaint and outmoded as the tricorn hat.\nDickens, however, not only bucked the trend but made a whole performance out of bucking it. When he was among friends, it was his custom to brew up a bowl of punch, complete with a running disquisition on the techniques he was using and the ingredients he was deploying, thus adding instruction to delight (as one of his characters might say). Fortunately, in 1847, he wrote the whole procedure out for a friend's wife. It's not hard to follow, and there's no better way to get a holiday party started than by getting everybody involved in draining a bowl of punch. All it takes is a little preparation in advance, a willingness to hold forth a bit in front of your guests, and a high enough ceiling that you won't burn your house down. Dickens was never afraid to employ cheap sensationalism if it would help him get over, and there's nothing more sensational for selling a drink than setting it on fire. Here's our interpretation.\nStep 1: Three hours before your party, peel 3 lemons with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, trying to end up with three long spirals of peel. Put them in a 3- or 4-quart fireproof bowl with 3/4 cup demerara sugar or other raw sugar. Muddle the peels and the sugar together and let sit.\nTalking Points: One of the secrets of punch making is to use the fragrant, sweet oil that resides in lemon peels as the sugar extract. The resulting sugar-oil mix (\"oleo-saccharum\") adds body to the punch.\nTalking Points: The cognac is for body and smoothness, the strong rum for bouquet and (frankly) flammability, and the other rum for taming the strong one.\nStep 3: Set 1 quart water to boil and put the bowl containing the lemon peels and sugar on a wooden cutting board or other heat-resistant surface in a spot where everyone can gather around. When the water boils, turn it off, gather your guests around the bowl, and pour in the cognac and rum, noting what you're adding and why.\nStep 4: With a long-handled barspoon, remove a spoonful of the rum-cognac mixture and set it on fire. Return it to the bowl, using it to ignite the rest.\nStir with a ladle or long-handled spoon, attempting to dissolve the sugar. Let burn for 2 or 3 minutes, occasionally lifting one of the lemon peels up so people can admire the flames running down it.\nTalking Points: You're setting the punch alight not because it looks cool but to burn off some of the more volatile elements of the alcohol. That's the story, anyway.\nStep 6: Grate fresh nutmeg over the top and ladle out in 3-oz servings.\nEsquire participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites."}
