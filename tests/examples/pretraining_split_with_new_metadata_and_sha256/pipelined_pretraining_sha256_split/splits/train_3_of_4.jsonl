{"prompt": "", "completion": "I usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren\u2019t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you\u2019ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He\u2019s very well-trained.\nI think it\u2019s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry\u2019s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change\u2026I don\u2019t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.\nHenry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They\u2019re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he\u2019s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn\u2019t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry\u2019s growth has a greater impact on both of them.\nIt was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn\u2019t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He\u2019s very loving, but he\u2019s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin\u2019s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.\nI anticipate going a little deeper into Martin\u2019s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I\u2019ll present from Martin\u2019s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they\u2019re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I\u2019ve already covered from Henry\u2019s perspective to some extent, and when I\u2019m writing Henry, I\u2019m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.\nOffering Martin\u2019s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin\u2019s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I\u2019ve gotten the impression (whether it\u2019s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry\u2019s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin\u2019s perspective is a valuable addition."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "The terrifying 38-minute ordeal suffered by Hawaii residents on Saturday, when the state\u2019s emergency-management agency sent out a false alert warning of an imminent ballistic-missile strike amid rising tensions with North Korea, seems to have sparked an unusually rapid response on Capitol Hill.\nHawaii\u2019s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don\u2019t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.\nInitial reports indicate that Hawaii\u2019s screwup\u2014which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later\u2014was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.\nOn Wednesday, Schatz said he had convened a phone call with officials from the Federal Communications Commission, the Homeland Security Department, the Pentagon, and other relevant agencies to address the inconsistency.\nThe way America\u2019s missile-alert system operates is fundamentally different from how citizens are alerted to most other catastrophes, when local authorities often possess the best information. While states and cities are ultimately responsible for alerting civilians of an imminent attack, they lack the ability to detect and track incoming missiles.\nIn the seconds and minutes after a launch, details of the threat would have to cascade through phone calls from the Pentagon to DHS. From there, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would send the warning to at-risk states and localities, whose own alert systems would only then spring into life.\nThat chain of causation was disrupted on Saturday. But David Simpson, a former admiral in the U.S. Navy who ran the FCC\u2019s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau from November 2013 to January 2017, said federal legislation should seek to dismantle that outdated process altogether.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a 1950s kind of structure,\u201d Simpson said, arguing that machine-to-machine communication technology should be utilized to eliminate lag time and cut down on human error.\nOne way to do that could be for the FCC to create, at the direction of Congress, a unique wireless-alert category for ballistic-missile threats. \u201cThat would then ensure that the machine elements of this system could be built around that narrow bucket,\u201d Simpson said.\nBut that still wouldn\u2019t solve the problem entirely. \u201cThe machine-to-machine piece of that, so it could be really useful, would require DHS and [Defense Department] plumbing changes that would be beyond the authorities of the FCC,\u201d Simpson said.\nSimpson largely endorsed Schatz\u2019s plan for a uniform federal missile-alert framework that states and localities can follow. \u201cThere\u2019s over 1,000 alert originators at the state and local level, and I would say five, six, seven vendors for the user-interface systems,\u201d he said.\nIn a bid to improve innovation, DHS gave state governments broad leeway to design their own missile-alert interfaces. But Simpson said that decision has clearly come with a cost.\nHouse Republicans are further along than their Senate counterparts, with plans to hold an Energy and Commerce hearing on Hawaii\u2019s false missile alert in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, committee chairman Greg Walden said he would be \u201chappy to work\u201d with Schatz on legislation, if needed. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got into the weeds on it,\u201d Walden said.\nAs long as lawmakers can work out issues surrounding committee and agency jurisdiction, Simpson said the chances for bipartisan support are high. But stakeholders from Homeland Security and the Pentagon\u2014as well as the congressional committees that oversee them\u2014will also need to weigh in. And Simpson worries those agencies may be loath to take responsibility for what\u2019s widely viewed as a state-level mistake.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect bipartisan issue, as long as we don\u2019t let the various lobbies and the competition between agencies pervert and potentially dilute the ultimate outcome,\u201d Simpson said.\n\"Two more House Republicans have joined the discharge petition to force votes on immigration, potentially leaving centrists just two signatures short of success. Reps. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) signed the discharge petition Thursday before the House left town for the Memorial Day recess. If all Democrats endorse the petition, just two more GOP signatures would be needed to reach the magic number of 218.\"\n\"A missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014 was fired from a launcher belonging to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, investigators said Thursday.

Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the incident.\"\n\"House Republicans are preparing to conduct the first interviews in over four months in their investigation into the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email probe. A joint investigation run by the Judiciary and Oversight Committees has set three witness interviews for June, including testimony from Bill Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division, and Michael Steinbach, the former head of the FBI\u2019s national security division.\"\n\"The White House confirmed Wednesday it is planning for a bipartisan group of House and Senate leaders, known as the 'Gang of 8,' to receive a highly-classified intelligence briefing on the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling, reversing plans to exclude Democrats altogether.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "In light of recent accounting scandals, there are widespread calls for the UK competition authority to re-examine the audit market. Yet spending a substantial amount of resources on a market investigation, and concluding once again that there is a competition problem, is of little value if a suitable remedy cannot be found. A break-up of the Big Four is perceived by many as a necessary and long-awaited intervention, but is it the right solution? And if not, what would be an alternative remedy?\nThe previous investigation by the UK Competition Commission (CC), predecessor to the CMA, put forward a package of seven remedies, the most significant of which was a requirement that FTSE 350 companies put their audit out to tender at least every ten years (\u2018mandatory tendering\u2019). Shortly thereafter, the EU introduced rules that obliged listed companies to switch their auditor (\u2018mandatory rotation\u2019) every 20 years. At the conclusion of the previous market investigation the CC expressed confidence in its package of remedies, noting that they should \u2018increase choice\u2019 and provide a \u2018substantially improved environment for competition\u2019. The CC\u2019s remedies package did not include any structural remedies.\nWhat could structural remedies achieve?\nHorizontal separation of the Big Four firms would immediately improve choice in the sense of seeing more than four firms in the market, and also choice in terms of seeing several non-conflicted audit firms in every audit tender. Such a separation would therefore also, in general terms, improve competition. It could also serve audit quality by reducing the number of instances where a company involved in a complex transaction cannot realistically find an adviser that is not subject to some conflict of interest.\nIn the case of Carillion, PwC acted as the company\u2019s pensions consultant (2002\u201317), then switched to advising the pension scheme trustees on Carillion\u2019s restructuring proposals (from July 2017), and was finally appointed by the government to help manage the defunct Carillion after its collapse (from January 2018). It would appear that PwC was the only viable choice to advise on Carillion\u2019s insolvency, because it was the only Big Four firm that did not have active contracts with Carillion at the time of Carillion\u2019s demise. Expanding the market from a \u2018Big Four\u2019 to a \u2018Large 6\u2019 seems attractive in the face of such apparent conflicts, but realistically it would be a very difficult exercise if the aim is to create a \u2018Large 6\u2019 group of firms of similar size with similar international networks.\nWould a break-up increase audit quality?\nAudits are for the protection of investors against false accounting by a company\u2019s management. The starting point is therefore that the true customer of audit, the investor, is not the procurer of audit services. This alone creates an environment in which market failures may be expected.\nBut why does audit quality fall short? Boeing and Airbus, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and the Silicon Valley giants all operate in concentrated markets\u2014but it seems highly unlikely that half of new aeroplanes, or soft drinks cans, possess substantial errors. Market concentration per se does not entail a poor-quality product: even a monopolist will have regard to product quality, knowing that if its product is faulty the financial consequences of fines and compensating consumers will typically be severe.\nIn equilibrium, a firm would only produce faulty items to the extent that it is rational to do so\u2014i.e. if errors cannot be detected or if the financial consequences of errors are insubstantial. It seems to be widely accepted that audit quality is below the level demanded by investors, on whose behalf the audit is undertaken. The economics literature on audit has studied the link between greater market concentration and higher audit fees, but this does not help us very much in the present circumstances, where the primary concerns are not to do with high prices, or even exclusionary conduct, but with limited choice and sub-optimal quality. Where does the solution lie?\nAre audit fines providing optimal enforcement?\nFrom an economics perspective, if the deterrence effect of penalties is sufficiently severe, firms that might otherwise chase market share by cutting prices and their costs for a given audit will be deterred from cutting quality. In other words, when deterrence is weak, there is an opportunity for rent-seeking by firms that cut quality on unobservable dimensions. Although it might be argued that the cost to an accountant\u2019s reputation is great enough to give the right incentives, this point seems difficult to sustain in light of the continued flourishing of firms that have had quite major hits to their professional reputations.\nEuropean Commission cartel fines are set based on the gravity and the duration of a competition infringement, and are capped at a maximum of 10% of a company\u2019s total turnover. The 10% turnover ceiling for fines is engaged only when a cartel fine based on the usual criteria would otherwise be set at more than 10% of turnover.\nCartel fines are large compared with audit fines, as Tables 1 and 2 illustrate. Looking at FRC audit fines in the cases mentioned above, the average fine is 0.016% of a Big Four firm\u2019s annual global turnover, as shown in Table 1. The final column of Table 1 indicates that increasing this percentage to 0.5% would lead to fines of a much greater order of magnitude. This is purely illustrative; it is not a recommendation as to the optimal size of audit fines.\nSource: FRC and the audit firms\u2019 annual reports for fiscal year 2017.\nSource: European Commission cartel statistics, last updated 21 March 2018.\nIt might be argued that increased deterrence for poor audit would come at the cost of competition, such as financial penalties leading to market exit and a \u2018Big Three\u2019, or hiking the barriers to entry for non-Big Four audit firms. Likewise, the Commission does not wish to fine a cartel with penalties that are so high that the consequence would be a reduction in the number of market competitors (or else the competition remedy would be self-defeating). Hence the scaling of cartel fines to turnover, and the \u2018inability to pay\u2019 test, whereby the Commission can reduce the scale of fines where it is shown that they pose a serious threat to the economic viability of the undertaking concerned. Scaling audit fines to audit firm turnover makes it unlikely that such penalties would deter entry or cause the market exit of one of the Big Four. The cartel fines policy therefore has useful principles, albeit it does not indicate the right order of magnitude for audit fines.\nSimilar research would be required to understand the effects of a different penalty regime for poor audit.\nThere is little doubt that a new CMA investigation would consider a break-up remedy. However, no matter what the divestments and structural changes, the inherent tension within the industry\u2019s \u2018client pays\u2019 business model is likely to remain\u2014that is, an auditor\u2019s basic conflict between serving the paying client and serving the greater good.\nIf it were to address that conflict, the CMA would need to look into penalties and deterrence, as well as studying the effects of a break-up remedy. It is not realistic to expect the CMA to be able to fix every major issue in the market by achieving the goal of reduced concentration in FTSE 350 audit.\nThe quality of audit might be improved with a more disaggregated market, but this link is not certain. Moreover, it is possible that greater deterrence for bad audit would lead to an organic change in market structure: the Big Four have expertise in advising clients as to when a substantial divestment or restructuring might increase shareholder value. It seems possible that, in a world of greater deterrence, the accounting firms might look inwards using this expertise and shake up the market structure themselves.\nFinally, the example of cartel fines shows that they are of a different scale to audit fines, raising the question as to whether fines should be reconsidered in the audit market. Penalties for anticompetitive conduct are used for prevention, not retribution. An audit firm with consistent high quality would have a minimal incidence of fines, which would place the high-quality firm at a competitive advantage to an audit firm with lower quality. If audit quality became high across the market, no firm would be faced with very substantial financial penalties, and investor perceptions as to the value of statutory audit might be restored. In summary: prevention is better than cure.\n Peter Kyle, Member of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, speaking at the pre-appointment hearing with the Government\u2019s preferred candidate for Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, HC 985, 24 April 2018.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Charles Dickens gave us so much. Including this.\nIn A Christmas Carol,when Ebenezer Scrooge is presented with the Ghost of Christmas Present, he finds the \"jolly Giant\" sitting in state on an enormous heap of roast meats and other traditional English Christmas delicacies and flanked by \"seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.\"\nCharles Dickens knew all about delicious steam.\nHe was a committed English traditionalist in his drinking. He didn't drink the international celebrity's customary champagne, champagne, and more champagne or the trendy drinks of his day \u2014 gin cocktails, claret cups, brandy smashes, or the like. Rather, his greatest affinity was for a drink that was fading faster and faster into the past by the time he came into fame. From 1700 to 1830, give or take a couple years on each end, the preeminent English social drink was the bowl of punch, a large-bore mixture of spirits (usually rum and cognac), citrus juice, sugar, water, and spice that was guaranteed to unite any gathering in jollity and boozy good cheer. But with the industrialization, commercialization, and urbanization of day-to-day life that the Victorian years brought, the convivial ritual of clustering around the flowing bowl became as quaint and outmoded as the tricorn hat.\nDickens, however, not only bucked the trend but made a whole performance out of bucking it. When he was among friends, it was his custom to brew up a bowl of punch, complete with a running disquisition on the techniques he was using and the ingredients he was deploying, thus adding instruction to delight (as one of his characters might say). Fortunately, in 1847, he wrote the whole procedure out for a friend's wife. It's not hard to follow, and there's no better way to get a holiday party started than by getting everybody involved in draining a bowl of punch. All it takes is a little preparation in advance, a willingness to hold forth a bit in front of your guests, and a high enough ceiling that you won't burn your house down. Dickens was never afraid to employ cheap sensationalism if it would help him get over, and there's nothing more sensational for selling a drink than setting it on fire. Here's our interpretation.\nStep 1: Three hours before your party, peel 3 lemons with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, trying to end up with three long spirals of peel. Put them in a 3- or 4-quart fireproof bowl with 3/4 cup demerara sugar or other raw sugar. Muddle the peels and the sugar together and let sit.\nTalking Points: One of the secrets of punch making is to use the fragrant, sweet oil that resides in lemon peels as the sugar extract. The resulting sugar-oil mix (\"oleo-saccharum\") adds body to the punch.\nTalking Points: The cognac is for body and smoothness, the strong rum for bouquet and (frankly) flammability, and the other rum for taming the strong one.\nStep 3: Set 1 quart water to boil and put the bowl containing the lemon peels and sugar on a wooden cutting board or other heat-resistant surface in a spot where everyone can gather around. When the water boils, turn it off, gather your guests around the bowl, and pour in the cognac and rum, noting what you're adding and why.\nStep 4: With a long-handled barspoon, remove a spoonful of the rum-cognac mixture and set it on fire. Return it to the bowl, using it to ignite the rest.\nStir with a ladle or long-handled spoon, attempting to dissolve the sugar. Let burn for 2 or 3 minutes, occasionally lifting one of the lemon peels up so people can admire the flames running down it.\nTalking Points: You're setting the punch alight not because it looks cool but to burn off some of the more volatile elements of the alcohol. That's the story, anyway.\nStep 6: Grate fresh nutmeg over the top and ladle out in 3-oz servings.\nEsquire participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites."}

We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.\n(Quantum) back action refers (in the regime of Quantum systems) to the effect of a detector on the measurement itself, as if the detector is not just making the measurement but also affecting the measured or observed system under a perturbing effect.\nBack action has important consequences on the measurement process and is a significant factor in measurements near the quantum limit, such as measurements approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL).\nWhen performing continuous measurements of position with sensitivity approaching quantum mechanical limits, one must confront the fundamental effects of detector back-action.Back-action forces are responsible for the ultimate limit on continuous position detection, can also be harnessed to cool the observed structure[1,2,3,4], and are expected to generate quantum entanglement.\nthen those same wavefunctions are transfered and produce a correlation at the ground state..\nwhere the ancilla takes on the new value/wavefunction.. and here we find all these ideas..\nand it may just BE the network and its computing speed, that even allows the wavefunction to be \"found\"\nWhile there are lots of things that artificial intelligence can't do yet\u2014science being one of them\u2014neural networks are proving themselves increasingly adept at a huge variety of pattern recognition ...

{"prompt": "", "completion": "I heard many horror stories which often ended with, \u201cwell, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.\u201d Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.\nI had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!\nTwo weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn\u2019t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn\u2019t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.\nMy husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn\u2019t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn\u2019t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen next.\nWe finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn\u2019t even dilated. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn\u2019t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!\nThe diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! \u201cFake labor\u201d would not be in my cards, I had hoped.\nFortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn\u2019t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn\u2019t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.\n\u201cWhen your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again\u201d the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.\nA couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was \u201cif I need something, I\u2019ll let you know. Thanks.\u201d I literally couldn\u2019t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.\nAs my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.\nI had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!\nAs I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on \u2026 I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn\u2019t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn\u2019t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn\u2019t have to feel any pain with an epidural.\nThere were no walking epidurals available though and I didn\u2019t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn\u2019t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.\nAs the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning \u2013 a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn\u2019t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn\u2019t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body\u2019s cues.\nI started to go along with my body\u2019s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren\u2019t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say \u201cpush, his body is stuck!\u201d I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.\nThe midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life. He was so slippery, I was terrified to grab him. I had never held a baby before. He would be my first. I held my son and put him on my chest. I couldn\u2019t stop looking at him in awe. He was so beautiful to me and I felt overwhelmed with love and joy.\nWhen the umbilical cord finally stopped pulsating, which happened surprisingly quick, my husband carefully snipped it. At this point, I\u2019m glad my husband didn\u2019t pass out. I always joked that he would get queasy and faint, but my husband did amazing!\nWhile holding my son, I had to deliver my placenta which did not hurt at all. In fact, I couldn\u2019t even feel much down below because of the adrenaline pumping throughout my veins.\nLooking into my son\u2019s eyes and holding him for the first time was the most incredible thing in the world. The pain that I felt earlier in labor vanished and I felt ecstatic to have made it through. It\u2019s true what they say \u2026 After your baby is born, you forget the pain of labor and birth.\nAt least most of it.\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Recently, I sat down to talk with a group of eight students from a large prominent church in Southern California. They were raised in the church. They were regulars at youth group. They claimed to be in relationship with Christ. Yet, they were dead. As I tried to engage them, most seemed unmoved and uninterested. And I was not surprised.\nAs I work with churches around the country, I encounter countless Christian students who are apathetic toward spiritual things. Their relationship with Christ is passionless. Talk of God is ho-hum. But why? Shouldn\u2019t our relationship with Christ be life\u2019s most exciting adventure? I\u2019m not suggesting the Christian life is one, big, emotional high, but why are students more willing to plug into their iPods than their Bibles? Why are they more excited about the latest celebrity gossip than the Gospel? Why aren\u2019t their lives filled with the drama of God\u2019s Kingdom?\nI think a big part of the problem is that Christian students rarely engage their world for the cause of Christ. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed in my training over the years. The most exciting events I do, the events where students seem to come to life, are those where there is some component of engagement. Let me illustrate.\nFor almost ten years now, I\u2019ve been taking students on mission trips to Berkeley and Utah. Each trip requires hours of training, typically in the form of classroom instruction and the reading of required books. This training is important and necessary, but it\u2019s not what generates the most buzz among the students. Students get fired up on the trip when we give them opportunities to engage non-believers.\nOn these trips we invite Mormon leaders, Unitarians, gay activists, Hare Krishna priests, skeptics, and atheists to dialogue with students. We give our non-Christian guests time to share their views, followed by a time of questions from our students. It\u2019s during Q&A when students really come to life. They ask question after question, graciously yet firmly force our skeptical guests to give a reason for their views. At the conclusion of each encounter, we thank our guests and then spend time debriefing. At this point, students are always abuzz, asking me question after question. Before I know it, an hour of discussing apologetics and theology with youth will have flown by.\nIn addition, we send our groups onto college campuses, like BYU or Berkeley, to conduct surveys. The surveys are designed to get our students into conversation with non-Christians students about spiritual issues. At first, students are fearful and anxious. They\u2019re skeptical about people\u2019s willingness to engage with them. But after an hour or two of surveys, students return and they are always pumped. During our debrief time, students can\u2019t wait to share about their encounters. They\u2019re filled with excitement about their conversations on campus with non-Christians.\nWhen we create opportunities for students to engage, there is a vibrancy that infuses the events. But this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Christianity is not a spectator sport. Our teaching should not remain in a classroom or behind the four walls of the church. If we want to train students who can defend the faith not just intelligently but passionately, we need to get them in the game. Think about any sports teams. It\u2019s the starters who are the most passionate about the game, right? The benchwarmers, not so much. I think that\u2019s one reason why our mission trips to Berkeley and Utah are exciting and successful. They get students in the game. They get students engaging a lost world with the truth of Jesus Christ.\nIn 2014, students will get a taste of being in the game as I take them to Berkeley and Utah. I\u2019ve already maxed out the number of mission trips I\u2019m capable of taking through July. Indeed, we\u2019ve had to turn groups away or ask them to start scheduling for 2015. So this year, we\u2019ll be getting students off the sidelines and igniting their fire for Christ. I can\u2019t wait."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "I admit I never thought I\u2019d do any analytical work on Resident Evil 4. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s one of my favorite games. Being extremely fun to play, and a having a wonderfully creepy aesthetic are just a few of the game\u2019s strengths. But it\u2019s a silly game in a lot of ways. There aren\u2019t larger messages and meanings to glean from it. And at some moments, the game mechanics and the overall story don\u2019t match up very well. I\u2019d like to discuss one of those moments: Luis\u2019s famous death in castle. I\u2019ll use this example to discuss the elements of motivation and capacity in video games.\nYou may recall from my previous article a discussion of a player\u2019s motivation and capacity while playing a video game. Although I mentioned these terms, I never adequately defined them, so I\u2019ll do so now. A player\u2019s motivation is the reason he or she cares about playing the game and effecting some kind of difference in the world and story in which he or she is immersed. This element is present in other mediums\u2014it\u2019s the reason we continue to read/watch the story. A player\u2019s capacity, unlike motivation, is intrinsically tied to game mechanics; it consists of the things that the player is able to do in the game world. The analogue of capacity in other media is simply the reader\u2019s ability to continue to watch or read the story. There are further complexities in games, however, including that a player\u2019s degree of capacity can effect his or her motivation, but that is a discussion for another time (probably focusing on Deus Ex). For now, recall my claim that in order for a game to be truly impactful, both of these elements must exist (or noticeably not exist, as I\u2019ll discuss in my next article). Note also that the capacity element is harder and more important to make present, since it\u2019s the element that video games have introduced to storytelling.\nSo let\u2019s see whether both motivation and capacity exist in the case of Luis\u2019s death. For those who haven\u2019t played the game, you can watch a video of the moment below.\nI\u2019ll summarize the scene: Luis was attempting to help you get a \u201csample\u201d of great value from the game\u2019s primary villain, Saddler. But Saddler kills Luis, taking back the sample (classic). As Luis lies dying before you, he gives you a temporary antidote to the parasite that you are infected with, and tells you to stop Saddler. When he finally passes away, Leon yells out him name in anguish.\nSo this moment most certainly provides the player with motivation. And there are multiple reasons for this. In his final moments, Luis literally gives the player the primary plot incentive for the remainder of the game: stop Saddler and get the sample back. On top of that, finding out that Leon isn\u2019t doomed to die at the hands of his parasite energies the player with a new sense of hope. But, most importantly, the player\u2019s motivation is an extension of Leon\u2019s grief. If the player empathizes with Leon (hopefully they do if they\u2019ve gotten this far in the game), when Leon cries out in agony over the death of his friend, the player, too, is motivated seek justice for a lost friend. This is the opposite of Link\u2019s silence that I discussed in my last article. Unlike Link, who leaves you to form your experience for yourself, Leon hands you his grief, and in this way motivates you to action. This is good storytelling. Clearly Resident Evil 4 has nailed the motivational aspect of making a powerful narrative in a game. But at this point there\u2019s no particular reason story-wise to play the game instead of just watching it.\nSo let\u2019s think about capacity. Capacity is the additional element that makes a video game unique as opposed to movies or books. And the extent of what video games can do with capacity hasn\u2019t been fully explored. So, even though it\u2019s not necessary for a game to use dynamics of capacity in order to tell a good story, ignoring this element is missing an opportunity for better storytelling. Since capacity is unique to games, if there\u2019s no interesting storytelling or fun mechanics, there\u2019s no reason to play the game instead of just watch it.\nNow, in order to discuss capacity in the case of death, capacity takes on a slight nuance. When a character dies in a game, the key aspect of capacity is actually the change in capacity. It doesn\u2019t matter so much what the capacity level is in general, it just matters if there is a difference before and after a character\u2019s death. This provides meaning for the death within the structure of the game mechanics. For example, if a character dies in a game but is immediately replaced by an almost identical analogue, their death has little visceral impact for the player, who can\u2019t feel the impact of the character\u2019s death on the gameplay. This actually does happen: in Legend of The Dragoon, when one of your party members, Lavitz, dies, Albert, who literally takes on the stats of Lavitz, almost immediately replaces him. Even more notably, Cait Sith dies in Final Fantasy VII, but is quite literally replaced by an entirely identical avatar called \u201cCait Sith 2\u201d. In these situations the player\u2019s capacity has not changed, and thus the deaths have lost some of their potential narrative impact.\nThat\u2019s kind of what it feels like when Luis dies in Resident Evil 4. Although he helps you out as a non-player character (NPC) at various points in the game, it\u2019s not as though he\u2019s the only character who does this. And there\u2019s nothing to distinguish him mechanics-wise from the other characters you meet and team up with. What\u2019s more, you continue to have access to other NPCs you can get help from after he dies. So, in terms of how it feels to play the game, you don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s gone. As far as the player\u2019s capacity to team up with others in order to stay alive, very little changes after Luis\u2019s death. The player\u2019s capacity thus changes very little when he dies, and though the player grieves with Leon, it\u2019s difficult to feel a real sense of loss.\nTo sum up, although the story of Luis\u2019s death in Resident Evil is well told in terms of movies and books, the developers missed the opportunity to tell this story through the game mechanics in terms of a change in player capacity. Luis was not a unique character mechanically, and other characters that Leon meets effectively replace his avatar. The death is meaningful to watch, but far less meaningful to play.\nNathan Randall is a Master\u2019s candidate in game design at FIEA.

It has been profitable for the last 5 years, but it has needed all of its earnings to support growth and thus has never paid a dividend. Management has indicated that it plans to pay a $0.50 dividend 3 years from today, then to increase it at a relatively rapid rate for 2 years with 50% dividend growth in year 4 and 25% dividend growth in year 5, and then to increase its dividend at a constant growth rate of 6.00% per year thereafter. Assuming a required return of 15.00%, what is your estimate of the intrinsic value of Beranek's stock?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Education Week reporter Ben Herold explores how technology is shaping teaching and learning and the management of schools. Join the discussion as he analyzes the latest developments.\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative are teaming up on a new research-and-development initiative aimed at identifying \"state-of-the-art\" educational strategies and bringing them to the classroom.\nThe focus is on spurring development of new measures, new ways of teaching, and new technologies for tracking and supporting students' writing ability, math skills, and \"executive functions,\" such as self-control and attention.\nIn a new Request for Information released today, the groups wrote that researchers from fields as diverse as education, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and technology are generating exciting new ideas about how people actually learn\u2014but that information \"has not yet been translated effectively into methods and tools for teachers and students to use in the classroom every day.\"\nSuch \"research insights must inform ongoing development of tools and instructional approaches that will enable students to overcome math, literacy, and other learning challenges and at scale, in order to reach millions, if not billions, of students,\" the document reads.\nImproving students' writing (especially non-fiction).\"The skills connected to writing\u2014evaluation of arguments and evidence, critical and creative thinking about solutions and sources, identifying support for a key idea or process, clear and evocative argument-making\u2014are frequently cited as 21st century skills in high demand by employers,\" the Request for Information states. \"Yet, the majority of high school graduates are not prepared for the demands of postsecondary and workplace writing.\"\nAmong the areas where the groups hope to see improvements: comprehensive writing solutions, new metrics for measuring student progress and proficiency in writing, and new tools to promote more collaboration and better feedback.\nImproving students' mathematical understanding, application, and related mindsets.Here, the language of the personalized-learning movement (which both organizations support) is clear: There already exist promising approaches that \"help teachers to address individual students' needs by mirroring the same personalized approaches used by the best 1:1 tutors,\" the document states. \"Highly personalized learning experiences and tools have the potential to analyze student responses to understand barriers to student learning, provide immediate feedback, and apply immediate and effective remediation to students when needed.\"\nAmong other things, the organizations are specifically looking for tools that can further personalize math instruction via a focus on the \"whole student\"\u2014including children's mindsets, beliefs, attention, and \"affective\" or emotional states.\nMeasuring and improving students' executive function.\"Student success in academics and in future careers is associated with their ability to wrestle with multiple ideas at once, think flexibly, and regulate their action and thoughts,\" the Request for Information states. \"There is much to be done to track and improve students' progress on [executive function] development and connect it to real-world benefits, especially for those who are most at-risk.\"\nAreas of focus here include advances in techniques for tracking children's development of these skills and abilities, interventions (including \"technology-enhanced programs in or outside of school\") designed to improve desired behaviors, and supports for teachers.\nThe Gates Foundation is a traditional charitable foundation, chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Over the last decade-plus, the group has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars a year to such education-related causes as promoting small high schools, changing the way teachers are evaluated, and supporting development of the Common Core State Standards. Last October, the Gates Foundation announced a strategic shift in focus, including a new emphasis on \"locally-driven solutions\" and \"innovative research.\"\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, meanwhile, is a newer entity, founded and led by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan. Structured as a limited-liability corporation, CZI is free to make charitable donations, invest in for-profit companies, and engage in political lobbying and advocacy, with minimal disclosure requirements. The venture-philanthropy group has announced that it will give hundreds of millions of dollars annually to support a vision of \"whole-child personalized learning\" that aims to customize each child's educational experience based on their academic, social, emotional, and physical strengths, needs, and preferences.\nLast June, the two groups announced their first substantive collaboration: a $12 million joint award to an intermediary organization known as New Profit, which in turns supports organizations working to promote personalized learning.\nIn their new Request for Information, the Gates Foundation and CZI said that technology is not the focus of what they hope to spur, but it is expected to play a role.\nThe groups also emphasized that their new plan is currently in draft stage. Individuals, nonprofit groups, universities, private companies, and government-sponsored labs are invited to respond, with the expectation that those groups' input will in turn shape the foundations' funding plans moving forward.\nNo decision has yet been made as to how much money the groups will ultimately invest in the new R&D effort.\nWhy this new partnership, and why now?\n\"The reason our two philanthropies have decided to join hands in this effort is simple: We believe the scope and importance of this work exceeds what any single organization can or should undertake alone,\" wrote CZI president of education Jim Shelton and Gates Foundation director of K-12 education Bob Hughes in an op-ed published today by Fast Company.\n\"The purpose of the initiative is not to mandate anything. It's to learn from the work that's currently happening in classrooms, universities, entrepreneurial efforts, and research centers throughout the country.\"\nNotice: We recently upgraded our comments.

Warranty for this item is 90 days as with all B Grade items.\nB Grade items may have been used, have damaged packaging, missing accessories or a combination of these.\nSome items may have scuff marks or slight scratches but should otherwise be an operable product.\nRenowned for producing some of the world best CPU coolers, Zalman have now released their newest flagship cooler, the CNPS12X. It is the world's first \"out of the box\" triple fan cooler and is compatible with Intel latest LGA2011 Sandy Bridge E processors.\nWorlds first \"out of the box\" triple fan CPU coolerThere are many CPU coolers available on the market that can accommodate three fans, but to make this happen at least one additional fan needs to be purchased which add to the expense. With the Zalman CNPS12X you get three 120mm blue LED fans built into the cooler so there is no extra costs. Also all three fans run off one fan header, making powering the fans extremely easy.\nSix W-DTH composite heatpipes for excellent heat transferFirst seen on the CNPS11X, composite heatpipes help transfer the heat from the CPU up to 50% faster than standard heatpipes. This helps to increase the performance of the cooler even further. The six heatpipes are U-shaped, which effectively double the heat transfer compared to none U-shaped heatpipes.At the base of the cooler (where the heatpipes make contact with the CPU) the heatpipes utilise what Zalman call Whole-Direct Touch Heatpipes (W-DTH). This allows the heatpipes to make direct contact with the CPU, another feature to help increase performance. But not only that, the area of the Direct Touch will cover the whole CPU. Even the new Intel CPUs for LGA2011 will also be covered by W-DTH.\n100% nickel plated with blue LED fans for amazing aestheticsMost CPU coolers are hidden inside the computer case where they go about their business unseen. But if you like to show off the internals of the PC you may want a CPU cooler than looks the part, and boy the CNPS12X does look the part!The entire heatsink of CNPS12X is plated with \"Black-Pearl\" nickel for a long-term corrosion resistance, while the deep \"Black-Pearl\" tone, along with the high intensity from the blue LED fans helps this cooler stand head and shoulders above the rest."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O Kuntze (Paran\u00e1 pine or Araucaria) is a potential forestry native species for Brazilian silviculture. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints persist, hindering its silvicultural expansion, among which are the lack of cloning technologies of superior genetic materials and their assessment under field conditions. Thus, we evaluated the potential use of araucaria plants derived from cuttings and seeds for timber production, by assessing field survival, growth and strobilus production using cuttings from male and female plants, collected from different positions, compared with those produced by sexual reproduction. Clones of male and female trees from different types of cuttings and seedlings were planted in 3 x 3 m spacing. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of one tree plot with three treatments. Female clones and apical cuttings showed higher growth in diameter at breast height (6.4 cm) and total height (3.6 m) 74 months after planting, followed by seedlings and other clones, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings technique is potential for araucaria propagation for wood production purposes, and it is favored by the use of apical cuttings from female mother trees."}
