{"prompt": "", "completion": "The terrifying 38-minute ordeal suffered by Hawaii residents on Saturday, when the state\u2019s emergency-management agency sent out a false alert warning of an imminent ballistic-missile strike amid rising tensions with North Korea, seems to have sparked an unusually rapid response on Capitol Hill.\nHawaii\u2019s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don\u2019t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.\nInitial reports indicate that Hawaii\u2019s screwup\u2014which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later\u2014was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.\nOn Wednesday, Schatz said he had convened a phone call with officials from the Federal Communications Commission, the Homeland Security Department, the Pentagon, and other relevant agencies to address the inconsistency.\nThe way America\u2019s missile-alert system operates is fundamentally different from how citizens are alerted to most other catastrophes, when local authorities often possess the best information. While states and cities are ultimately responsible for alerting civilians of an imminent attack, they lack the ability to detect and track incoming missiles.\nIn the seconds and minutes after a launch, details of the threat would have to cascade through phone calls from the Pentagon to DHS. From there, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would send the warning to at-risk states and localities, whose own alert systems would only then spring into life.\nThat chain of causation was disrupted on Saturday. But David Simpson, a former admiral in the U.S. Navy who ran the FCC\u2019s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau from November 2013 to January 2017, said federal legislation should seek to dismantle that outdated process altogether.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a 1950s kind of structure,\u201d Simpson said, arguing that machine-to-machine communication technology should be utilized to eliminate lag time and cut down on human error.\nOne way to do that could be for the FCC to create, at the direction of Congress, a unique wireless-alert category for ballistic-missile threats. \u201cThat would then ensure that the machine elements of this system could be built around that narrow bucket,\u201d Simpson said.\nBut that still wouldn\u2019t solve the problem entirely. \u201cThe machine-to-machine piece of that, so it could be really useful, would require DHS and [Defense Department] plumbing changes that would be beyond the authorities of the FCC,\u201d Simpson said.\nSimpson largely endorsed Schatz\u2019s plan for a uniform federal missile-alert framework that states and localities can follow. \u201cThere\u2019s over 1,000 alert originators at the state and local level, and I would say five, six, seven vendors for the user-interface systems,\u201d he said.\nIn a bid to improve innovation, DHS gave state governments broad leeway to design their own missile-alert interfaces. But Simpson said that decision has clearly come with a cost.\nHouse Republicans are further along than their Senate counterparts, with plans to hold an Energy and Commerce hearing on Hawaii\u2019s false missile alert in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, committee chairman Greg Walden said he would be \u201chappy to work\u201d with Schatz on legislation, if needed. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got into the weeds on it,\u201d Walden said.\nAs long as lawmakers can work out issues surrounding committee and agency jurisdiction, Simpson said the chances for bipartisan support are high. But stakeholders from Homeland Security and the Pentagon\u2014as well as the congressional committees that oversee them\u2014will also need to weigh in. And Simpson worries those agencies may be loath to take responsibility for what\u2019s widely viewed as a state-level mistake.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect bipartisan issue, as long as we don\u2019t let the various lobbies and the competition between agencies pervert and potentially dilute the ultimate outcome,\u201d Simpson said.\n\"Two more House Republicans have joined the discharge petition to force votes on immigration, potentially leaving centrists just two signatures short of success. Reps. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) signed the discharge petition Thursday before the House left town for the Memorial Day recess. If all Democrats endorse the petition, just two more GOP signatures would be needed to reach the magic number of 218.\"\n\"A missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014 was fired from a launcher belonging to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, investigators said Thursday. The announcement is the first time the investigative team has identified a specific division of the Russian military as possibly being involved in the strike. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the incident.\"\n\"House Republicans are preparing to conduct the first interviews in over four months in their investigation into the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email probe. A joint investigation run by the Judiciary and Oversight Committees has set three witness interviews for June, including testimony from Bill Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division, and Michael Steinbach, the former head of the FBI\u2019s national security division.\"\n\"The White House confirmed Wednesday it is planning for a bipartisan group of House and Senate leaders, known as the 'Gang of 8,' to receive a highly-classified intelligence briefing on the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling, reversing plans to exclude Democrats altogether. ABC News first reported the plans to hold a separate briefing for Democrats, citing multiple administration and congressional sources. While details of the bipartisan meeting are still being worked out, a Republican-only briefing will go on as scheduled Thursday.\""}
