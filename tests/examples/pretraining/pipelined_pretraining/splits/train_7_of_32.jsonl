{"prompt": "", "completion": "I've learned the nitrogen vacancies used in Memristors are for \"switching\", between excited states and inhibited states, akin to our neurons and SYNAPSES abilities to generate EPSPs and IPSPs, this is the entire point to Memristors and DARPAs SyNAPSE program, emulating Neurons..\nReturn to \"resting states\", just like Neurons do, hence Inhibitory states versus excited states, when a neuron reaches an action potential and fires..\nSo by weakly measuring certain aspects of living neurons, it is possible to superbroadcast/ teleport the wavefunction non-classically to the memristors vacancies, correlating each memristor with its neuron statistical ensemble counterpart, sharing the quantum state of the resting potential.\nthe ground state of the ancilla.\nThe type of measurement determines which property is shown. However the single and double-slit experiment and other experiments show that some effects of wave and particle can be measured in one measurement.\nWhen for example measuring a photon using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second beam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted. The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler\u2019s famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object.\nand the no-cloning theorem is about pure states..\nBut an ensemble of particles in a neuron would make it a mixed state..\nThe no-cloning theorem is normally stated and proven for pure states; the no-broadcast theorem generalizes this result to mixed states.\nApparently, worrying about measuring both position and momentum works differently for particles than it does waves.\nIt may actually be possible using phase.\nBohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.\nAnd \"quadratures\" is about position and momentum..\nWhich are apparently always orthogonal to each other.\nThere is obviously something to all of this.\nCounterfactual Communication was recently used to transmit information without sending any PARTICLES.\nthe information was sent in the phase.. of a wavefunction?\nand it used MachZenhder Interferometry..\nwhich is part of Quantum Metrology and its ability to harness non-classical states..\nand all of this can teleport non-classical light..\nand it all uses ANCILLAS... which store VALUES, and WAVEFUNCTIONS.. because they are Qubits/ Nitrogen vacancies..\nand are used in WEAK MEASUREMENT... which was used to measure a wavefunction.. something most would argue is impossible.. because of the uncertainty principle..\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics can be said to involve the use of counterfactual definiteness if it includes in the statistical population of measurement results, any measurements that are counterfactual because they are excluded by the quantum mechanical impossibility of simultaneous measurement of conjugate pairs of properties.\nand its the Ancillas that store values.. and may or may not be part of the measurement apparatus... / interferometer..\nThe quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways but the common apparatus considered to date features a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer. The quantum computer is set in a superposition of \"not running\" and \"running\" states by means such as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Those state histories are quantum interfered. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the \"not running\" state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. Measuring that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations such as Grover's algorithm even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer.\nwhich measured particles are \"cooled\" into for measurement techniques. a literal form of \"photon counting\"..\nlifetime of a few nanoseconds of the lowest vibrational level of the first excited state.\nDe-excitation from the excited singlet state to the ground state also occurs by other mechanisms, such as non-radiant thermal decay or \u2018phosphorescence\u2019. In the latter case, the chromophore undergoes a forbidden transition from the excited singlet state into the triplet state (intersystem crossing, ISC, Fig 2.4), which has a non-zero probability, for example because of spin orbit coupling of the electrons\u2019 magnetic moments\"\ndoing a search for Intersystem crossing, memristor brings up this link..\nA composite optical microcavity, in which nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond nanopillar are coupled to whispering gallery modes in a silica microsphere, is demonstrated. Nanopillars with a diameter as small as 200 nm are fabricated from a bulk diamond crystal by reactive ion etching and are positioned with nanometer precision near the equator of a silica microsphere. The composite nanopillar-microsphere system overcomes the poor controllability of a nanocrystal-based microcavity system and takes full advantage of the exceptional spin properties of NV centers and the ultrahigh quality factor of silica microspheres.\ncharacteristic form of I/V curves of manufactured devices.\nor  even with a simple linear drift of w.\nis the integral of voltage v(t) over time: \u03c6 = R v(t) dt.\nwhich must become the GROUND STATE of the ANCILLA upon non-classical correlation..\nWe investigate theoretically how the spectroscopy of an ancillary qubit can probe cavity (circuit) QED ground states containing photons. We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.\n(Quantum) back action refers (in the regime of Quantum systems) to the effect of a detector on the measurement itself, as if the detector is not just making the measurement but also affecting the measured or observed system under a perturbing effect.\nBack action has important consequences on the measurement process and is a significant factor in measurements near the quantum limit, such as measurements approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL).\nWhen performing continuous measurements of position with sensitivity approaching quantum mechanical limits, one must confront the fundamental effects of detector back-action.Back-action forces are responsible for the ultimate limit on continuous position detection, can also be harnessed to cool the observed structure[1,2,3,4], and are expected to generate quantum entanglement.\nthen those same wavefunctions are transfered and produce a correlation at the ground state..\nwhere the ancilla takes on the new value/wavefunction.. and here we find all these ideas..\nand it may just BE the network and its computing speed, that even allows the wavefunction to be \"found\"\nWhile there are lots of things that artificial intelligence can't do yet\u2014science being one of them\u2014neural networks are proving themselves increasingly adept at a huge variety of pattern recognition ... That's due in part to the description of a quantum system called its wavefunction. ...
