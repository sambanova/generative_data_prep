{"prompt": "", "completion": "Question by Jon: What is the best way to interact with or select job recruiters?\nI work primarily as a front end web developer and get calls from multiple recruitment firms. I do a fair bit of project work, so this is a recurring thing for me. Currently, if they have a position that I\u2019m a fit for I reflexively ask them to present me for that position. Is that an optimal strategy? If one company submits me, another cannot, so I want to be submitted by the best company. Should I therefore be taking steps to identify which recruiting firms are the most effective, give preference to local firms, find which firms ask the target employer for a smaller fee, select (somehow) for firms that have a better relationship with the target client, check out a firm\u2019s reputation online before submittal, etc. Or is all of that wasted work?\nI\u2019m looking for things that are efficient yet effective. Thanks for any tips!\nYes, I know I can work with several agencies for different jobs. However I CAN\u2019T work with several agencies for the SAME JOB. Not in California, in any case. Double submissions get thrown out, or else the second agency to submit is rejected."}
