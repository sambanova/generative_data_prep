The game appeared in severe danger of being abandoned after half-time when the pitch became shrouded in thick fog.
However the Republic looked to have snatched victory when Robbie Brady hit a precious away goal on 82 minutes.
But Edin Dzeko levelled three minutes later to leave the play-off in the balance going into Monday's second leg.

Republic manager Martin O'Neill will hope the possible return of Shane Long, Jon Walters and John O'Shea will give them impetus for the Dublin contest.
Southampton striker Long may be available again after injury while O'Neill may also welcome back the influential O'Shea and Walters after suspension.
With the Republic having scored the away goal, a 0-0 draw at the Aviva Stadium will be enough to secure the Irish a finals berth in France.
Brady struggled for much of the contest as both he and Republic left-back Stephen Ward found Bosnia right-sided midfielder Edin Visca a handful.
The Norwich winger's goal came in his only piece of attacking play of note as he cut inside Toni Sunuci before beating Bosnia's Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic at his near post with a shot from 14 yards.
Brady's goal could hardly be seen from the stands such was the fog that had enveloped the Bilino Polje Stadium in Zenica.
At that stage, the Irish - after being second best for most of the contest - looked on course to be in firm control of the play-off going into the second leg.
However, the Republic's left-sided flank was once again exploited three minutes later as Ognjen Vranjes got in behind Ireland substitute James McClean before squaring for Roma star Dzeko to poke past Darren Randolph.
With Visca a threat from early on, the Republic had a couple of nervous first-half moments as Vedad Ibisevic fired into the side-netting from close range and Senad Lulic then failed to divert an Ervin Zukanovic header past Randolph, when only a touch was needed.
However, Bosnia playmaker Miralem Pjanic struggled to impose himself on the contest while his Roma...

I was torn on how to rank this. There is part of me that wants to go a little lower, but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star. \n\nThis Marriott is about the level of a nicer Courtyard Marriott. The ONLY way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. If we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space, we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. A cocktail reception on a Tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud, but no problem due to our suite.   However a gathering of incredibly loud, rude teenagers whose director used a BULLHORN at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. We had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.  \n\nAdditional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very, very limited. Every other Marriott (including most Courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day, not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. At this one, there is none during the day, and, most frustrating, in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. Not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. Plus the coffee is not high quality. The attendants were very kind, but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.\n\nI also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. Prior to that, the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm, which is our daughters naptime, and she was along with us on this trip. It was a little frustrating.  As for the ACTUAL service, it was hit or miss. One day was great, replenished our towels, toiletries, took out the trash. Another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the... My rating for this place is

Okay, I am not sure what has possessed me to return to this place after my first experience there.  The only thing that I can think of is that the passage of time dulled my senses and made me forget about my prior experiences, but I have written myself a note reminding myself to avoid this place in the future. \n\nThis restaurant has survived on the hype of being one of the only \"nice\" places downtown, but luckily that has changed.  I went there for dinner one night and because I did not feel like ordering a $20 salad, I decided to order a $15 sandwich.  THe only thing that I can think of is that upon hearing my order the \"chef\" immediately ran down to the nearest vending machine and got a roast beef sandwich out of that vending machine, took the sandwich out of the plastic wrap and plopped it down on the plate and actually had the gonads to serve it as if they made it!  It was by far the worst meal I have had in some time and is a constant reminder why I will not eat there again, unless my Alzheimers kicks in.  \n\nIf you have to go there my recommendation is that you eat before hand and simply order a martini.\n\nikk8ide 2ccccccc.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A nomad scavenger treks through an irradiated wasteland and discovers a buried robot. He collects the pieces and takes them to junk dealer Alvy, who is talking with 'Hard Mo' Baxter, a former soldier, and Mo's friend Shades. When Alvy steps away, Mo buys the robot parts from the nomad and sells all but the head to Alvy. Intrigued by the technology, Alvy begins to research its background. Mo and Shades visit Jill, Mo's reclusive girlfriend, and, after an initially distant welcome where Jill checks them with a Geiger counter, Mo presents the robot head as a Christmas gift. Jill, a metal sculptor, eagerly accepts the head. After Shades leaves, Mo and Jill argue about a government sterilization plan and the morality of having children. Later, they have sex, while being unknowingly watched by their foul-mouthed, perverted, voyeuristic neighbor Lincoln Weinberg via telescope.
Jill works the robot head into a sculpture, and Mo says that he likes the work, but he does not understand what it represents. Frustrated, Jill says it represents nothing and resents Mo's suggestion that she make more commercial art to sell. They are interrupted by Alvy, who urges Mo to return to the shop, as he has important news about the robot, which he says is a M.A.R.K. 13. Before he leaves, Mo checks his Bible, where he finds the phrase "No flesh shall be spared" under Mark 13:20, and he becomes suspicious that the robot is part of a government plot for human genocide. Mo finds Alvy dead of a cytotoxin and evidence that the robot is an experimental combat model capable of self-repair; Alvy's notes also indicate a defect, a weakness to humidity. Worried, Mo contacts Shades and asks him to check on Jill, but Shades is in the middle of a drug trip and barely coherent.
Back at the apartment, the robot has reassembled itself using pieces of Jill's metal sculptures and recharged by draining her apartment's power network. It attempts to kill Jill, but she traps it in a room after the apartment's doors lock. Lincoln sees the robot close the...

Nineteen Chapecoense players and staff were among 71 people killed in a plane crash as the team travelled to Colombia for the Copa Sudamericana's first leg.
The friendly would be for the Joan Gamper trophy, which is an annual match between Barcelona and an invited team.
In a statement, Barcelona said they wanted to "pay tribute" to the victims and help Chapecoense recover.
Three Chapecoense players were among six people to survive the crash.
Barcelona said they wanted to make the Joan Gamper trophy "a great tribute to the world of football through various activities around this match".
"Along with the invitation to Chapecoense to the 2017 Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona would like to collaborate on the institutional and sporting reconstruction of the club, and help to recover the competitive level that it had," they added.
"Barcelona has today sent a formal letter of invitation to the current board of directors of Chapecoense."

Title: Watch for allergic reaction!
Product review: Like other reviewers, my son also had a terrible rash after we switched from Swaddlers to Cruisers. Our pediatrician had no idea what it was and prescribed an anti-fungal ointment and a hydrocortisone lotion. After more than a week using both, the rash just continued to get worse. We bought a package of Pampers Baby Dry just to see if a different diaper helped, and the rash cleared up within two days. I didn't really believe that it was the Cruisers diapers causing the rash since the Swaddlers and Baby Dry were fine (all Pampers brand), but when we tried using the Cruisers on him again a few weeks later (we had a ton left over) the rash came back after just a day. I did a quick search online and found lots of people have this problem. If you use these diapers, watch carefully for a rash and change to a different line of diapers right away if you see it and save your baby the pain and discomfort!

I glanced over all these rave reviews and I'm sorry I get lazy to go into detail bc it seems so redundant!  So, here's another gushing review of this place, I'll try and keep it short!\nCame here for a lovely Valentine's dinner and..\nIt's awesome. So far, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  \nLove the dark decor with purple furnishings, dazzling chandeliers, glod accents, and plush cushions.  Their service was on point.  The plating was beautiful and flowed nicely.  The only thing I didn't enjoy were their fake candles.  I guess they got sick of scraping wax off the tables?\nMy favorite is the bread cart--I'm a carb girl.  I could sit there and eat bread all day and be satisfied.  We had the 4-course dinner and we were beyond full by the time we got to dessert.  I'm not sure how people eat the 6 course or even the 16 course tastings.  I guess you'd have to skip out on the bread.\nThe foie gras was my favorite, as usual.  It literally melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting MORE. The second favorite was the dessert cart with coffee.  I love picking and choosing and then picking more! Just like the bread cart my eyes get big and I get greedy! \nCan't wait to come here again so I can try the 16 course tasting.  Gotta save something for next time, right?

Context: The Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by Å tokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries. These migrations caused the koinÃ©isation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, Å tokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken.;

Question: What has caused Stokavian to become more widely spoken?

At least 54 people were arrested and dozens of people injured. At one point a police officer fired two gunshots in warning.
The unrest sparked the hashtag #fishballrevolution - but this was about more than snacks.
Each year for the Lunar New Year holiday, food hawkers set up old-fashioned stalls selling traditional local snacks to people out celebrating.
This year, the hawkers set up on the pavement along the junction of Shan Tung Road and Portland Street in Kowloon, north of the business district of Hong Kong island.
For many local people, a trip to the temporary night market to try some fishballs, grilled meat or other nostalgic favourites is a central part of the holiday.
Unlike year-round food stalls these are not licensed and do not pay rent, but generally the authorities turn a blind eye to this.
Last year, however, the authorities tried and failed to crack down on the unlicensed stalls.
This year, they tried again. News of the plan reached local activists who were keen to oppose any moves they deem to be threatening local traditions.
On Monday, one group posted a video of the night market on its Facebook page, urging its supporters to come down and protect it.
Dozens of people had gathered to defend the vendors by the time the inspectors turned up on Monday night.
As news of the confrontation between police and protesters spread through social media, more people showed up
Among those supporting the vendors were so-called "localist" groups, small political groups and parties who favour greater autonomy for Hong Kong.
"Localist" groups have become more prominent in recent years, amid increased tensions with mainland China and frustration at what is seen as the slow pace of democratic reform.
Many people were left frustrated by what is widely seen as the failure of the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets to call for fully democratic elections in Hong Kong.
But "localist" groups are considered particularly radical, because they are strongly anti-Beijing and...

Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.

Context: Genome-wide association studies have found 27 genetic variants that are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Strongest association of MI has been found with the 9p21 genomic locus, which contains genes CDKN2A & 2B, although the single nucleotide polymorphisms that are implicated are within a non-coding region. The majority of these variants are in regions that have not been previously implicated in coronary artery disease. The following genes have an association with MI: PCSK9, SORT1, MIA3, WDR12, MRAS, PHACTR1, LPA, TCF21, MTHFDSL, ZC3HC1, CDKN2A, 2B, ABO, PDGF0, APOA5, MNF1ASM283, COL4A1, HHIPC1, SMAD3, ADAMTS7, RAS1, SMG6, SNF8, LDLR, SLC5A3, MRPS6, KCNE2.;

Question: Who do Maggie and Herbie catch up to?
Movie plot title: Herbie: Fully Loaded
Movie plot: The plucky little #53 VW Bug named Herbie was once one of the most popular vehicles on the racing circuit in his day. However, over time, his popularity waned, until he eventually finds himself in the hands of a junk yard owner named Crazy Dave, who is planning to eventually crush the little beetle into scrap.Meanwhile, Maggie Peyton has just graduated from college, and is planning to head to New York after the summer to work for ESPN. Though she appears happy for these plans, she secretly harbors a wish to race just like her Father, Grandfather, and Brother. However, while her Father and Grandfather had the 'ambition and drive,' her brother Rey Payton Jr just doesn't have it.After her graduation, Rey Payton Sr takes his daughter to Crazy Dave's to pick out a used car of her own. Through a mishap perpetrated by Herbie, Maggie ends up as the beetle's new owner. However, once she starts Herbie up, he takes off in a mad dash to a nearby garage, owned by a young man named Kevin, who is a friend of Maggie's.Noting Herbie's condition, Kevin decides to go with Maggie for a drive to test Herbie out. However, Herbie ends up driving the two of them to a local exotic car show, where famed NASCAR racer Trip Murphy is making a publicity appearance. After Trip makes a rude comment about Herbie's condition, the little beetle creates a major scratch along the side of Trip's personal vehicle. A race soon ensues, and Maggie (wearing a racing outfit with a darkened helmet), manages to beat Trip.Herbie's beating Trip gives Maggie a thrill from winning a street race (something she promised her Dad she wouldn't do again after a serious accident some time before), but plunges Trip into a deep grudge over being beaten by an old VW beetle. Even though his manager (and brother) tells Trip to just ignore the 'fluke win,' Trip is determined to get back at Herbie and his racer. Trip then advertises a special racing event in the desert with the promise of a $10,000 cash prize to the person who beats him.The ad catches the eye of Maggie...

Review: My husband and I ate at Inka Fest Peruvian Restaurant tonight.  The place has only been open since December 2010, but they have the menu down pat.   We had empanadas as an appetizer.  The pastry was light and flaky and the meat filling quite savory.  I had Pescado Sudado which is fish fillet steamed in a tomato sauce with thick-sliced onions and yucca.  The fish was amazingly tender.  My husband had Arroz con Mariscos, a paella that was chock full of a variety of seafood.  We topped dinner off with Peruvian ice cream.\n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable (my fish dish was $9.95) and the wait staff very pleasant and accomodating.  There is a TV that we asked them to turn down and they had no problem with that, completely turning off the volume for us.\n\nWe'll definitely be back, and bring friends with us.

The club itself is amaaazing - if you can get inside, that is. Anytime I've been with a group of girls, it's been super easy to just breeze in. But if you're with a guy - forget it.\n\nThe dance floor is super air-conditioned...something that no other club in Vegas has caught on to, it seems. The outdoor area by the pool is really pretty and also great for cooling off (or hiding from freaks on the dance floor).\n\nThe only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is b/c of the door guys. They're total douchebags and assholes. Worse than any of the other nightclubs in Vegas. Thank God I've never been on the receiving end of their bullshit \"discretion\" but I've seen them throw guys out of the line simply b/c they complained amongst themselves about how they've been waiting for 3 hours and its their birthday, and have seen countless people go inside before them b/c they tipped the door guys. I mean, ultimately you should just follow their example and tip them too if you really want to get in that bad but its unnecessary to throw people out just for speaking the truth out loud. Come on...that seems a little Commie-like, no?\n\nAnyway, despite the guido security (all-white suits + really really orange skin + top 3 buttons undone + chest hair poking out + gold chains....UGH), I really like Tryst and try to come back every time I'm in Sin City.

The first time I watched this film, I must have been about nine or ten and even at that age, I sobbed my heart out. To this day, it remains the saddest film I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film revolves around eight-year-old Ben Madison, a haemophiliac who contracted AIDS from an infected blood transfusion. As Ben bravely copes with all that his devastating illness forces upon him, his parents are fighting two battles. They have to struggle to accept the fact their young son was terminally ill yet remain strong enough to prepare him for his own death but they are also fighting the ignorance of how AIDS was perceived in the Eighties.<br /><br />'Go Toward the Light' has many emotive scenes: notably, Ben's funeral where his mother recounts how her son's life may have been short but he had made his mark on the world, when Ben's father explains to his three young sons about what happens to the soul after death, and the final scene where Ben dies in his parents' arms. What makes this film unique is that it's not all depressing and, by depicting happier scenes, we feel closer to Ben and his family. We shared their joy when Ben is able to come home for his new brother's birth and when the Madisons' newborn son was haemophiliac-free. We get a sense of how close the family is by the large role the grandparents play in Ben's life (his grandfather poignantly made Ben's coffin) and the love Ben feels for his family, especially his brothers (one bittersweet moment is when his younger brother says he was visited by a ghostly Ben in the hours before Ben's death).<br /><br />For a TV film, not only was the script excellent but so were the actors. Young Joshua Harris must have been a talented child actor in his time given his affecting performance as Ben while Linda Hamilton and Richard Thomas were perfect as the parents, depicting their grief, strength and love for their son and his plight.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to not only people seeking a good gut-wrenching drama (as there is nothing more gut-wrenching than...

Eh, this place was cool (haha no pun intended) but defintely not worth the crazy price you had to pay.  Honestly had we not had a coupon for this place, we wouldn't have gone.  The idea is really neat to make an entire bar out of ice, except that this place was just the size of a giant walk in meat locker with a tiny little bar.  Also, when we went there were literallly 2 other people in the whole place, and at some point the bartender just walked out so I couldn't order another drink if I wanted to.  I guess they make enough money elsewhere  that doesn't matter, because you can't take your phone/camera in and they charge you stupid amounts to have your picture just like you would if you rode a rollercoaster at an amusement park. \n\nTip- DONT PAY FULL PRICE AT THIS PLACE!! there are coupons floating around everywhere and I'm pretty sure we got in using a buy one get one. ALSO the girls were handing out free shot coupons before we went in.  Definitely take advantage of this!\n\nIt was an experience, not sure I'd go back... unless for something crazy like a bachellorette bikini party in the ice bar (theres all sorts of pics of people doing/wearing crazy things in there).

This place is a little off the beaten path, but it's always the hidden gems that deliver the most delicious dishes. There were so many choices on the menu, my head was spinning. So my husband and I decided to go with the pit special so we could try as many meats and sides as possible. I'm just going to say you can't go wrong with any of the BBQ fare. The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links- all amazing! The hot links were nice and spicy and all the other meat was super tender and delectable. \nThe beans were a great side- thick and chunky with big pieces of pork mixed throughout. Yum yum. The potato salad had crispy pieces of bacon on top which launched it into a new level of awesome-ness. The fried okra was perfectly breaded and fried. No extra salt required. The mac and cheese just seemed like a dud next to all the other sides, so I'd skip that one if possible.\nAs for the dessert- the peach cobbler was too much peach and not enough cobbler. You could tell that they used a canned peach to make it and it was just not doing it for me. The peach cobbler wasn't the best, but maybe i'll try the banana pudding next time.

Three priority areas were identified: first, the reform of the security sector; second, the promotion of good governance and the rule of law; and third, the revitalization of communities affected by conflicts. On 12 June 2008, the Central African Republic requested assistance from the UN Peacebuilding Commission, which was set up in 2005 to help countries emerging from conflict avoid devolving back into war or chaos.

Weeks after ending the Sex Pistols, Lydon formed the experimental group Public Image Ltd and declared the project to be "anti music of any kind". Public Image and other acts such as the Pop Group and the Slits had begun experimenting with dance music, dub production techniques and the avant-garde, while punk-indebted Manchester acts such as Joy Division, The Fall and A Certain Ratio developed unique styles which drew on a similarly disparate range of influences across music and modernist literature. Bands such as Scritti Politti, Gang of Four and This Heat incorporated Leftist political philosophy and their own art school studies in their work.
