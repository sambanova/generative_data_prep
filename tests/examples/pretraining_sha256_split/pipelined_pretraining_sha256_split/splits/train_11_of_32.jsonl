{"prompt": "", "completion": "New Nuclear Watch Europe (NNWE) invites you to attend our upcoming Parliamentary Briefing on The future of nuclear energy in Europe following Brexit, due to be held in the House of Commons, London, on the 14 March 2017 at 16.00.\nThe event will focus on the opportunities and challenges facing the nuclear energy sector across Europe following Brexit. With the UK moving forward with a pipeline of new nuclear build projects, most recently with the CGN-EDF Hualong 1 application for GDA approval, this event will bring together leading policymakers, industry, academics and commentators to discuss how Europe can continue to be a global leader in nuclear energy development.\nNNWE intends to promote discussion on the need for a Pan-European, or EU+, policy framework when discussing new nuclear build. With Brexit likely to occur in 2019, and the recent announcement that the UK will be pulling out of the Euratom Treaty, NNWE envisages the development of an Organisation for Nuclear Cooperation and Development in Europe, to continue and further enhance nuclear cooperation.\nThe latest EU PINC report highlights that 105GWe of new nuclear generation will be needed by 2050 \u2013 roughly 100 new reactors \u2013 to meet existing demand and climate change targets. However, only eighteen nuclear power plants are in development, planned, or proposed within the European Union itself. Whereas ninety-five reactors are planned throughout our EU neighbours \u2013 including Belarus, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and now the UK. NNWE believes an organisation is needed to drive the future of nuclear energy development across Europe and help us reach the ambitious 2050 target.\nNNWE was established at the end of 2014 under the chairmanship of Tim Yeo (former UK Member of Parliament and Chair of the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee) and is an interest group which aims to ensure nuclear power is recognised as an important and desirable way for European governments to meet the long-term security needs of their countries."}

Normally at this time we\u2019d be stuck pondering what was to come based off early product sheets and such, but this time around we\u2019ve got high res previews of everything for your viewing pleasure. This time around: the Air Jordan 7 \u201cFrench Blue\u201d. So far the group of Spring 2015 Air Jordans has been a newer leaning group, and this retro+ colorway sticks with that trend.

One of the most amazing cities in the world! Probably the only SPOT where you can get to the slopes in less then 15 minutes.\nSadly this year K.O.T. Gruam was boycotted by bad weather, misunderstanding and lack of snow. But still some warriors showed up for chilling and grilling under the Dragon tent (thank you Dragon so much for keeping us dry)."}
