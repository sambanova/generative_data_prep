{"prompt": "", "completion": "This is my first post on the board, and I'm glad to see there is a section specifically on Spanish wines as they've always been a favorite of mine!\nI recently drank the wine mentioned in the tile and absoultely loved it. The only problem is that I bought it in Sevilla, and haven't been able to find the exact wine at the local wine superstores. Any advice on how to find if this wine is imported and how to get it.\nWelcome to the board, MrB. A Website we commonly use when looking for an elusive bottle is wine-searcher.com, but unfortunately it turned up a no-find. Also checked my regional benchmark, Spec's in Houston, with the same result. You may need to settle for a reasonable sub.\nDespite all you see in the stores, both Spain and Italy (the largest wine producers in the world) only export a relatively small number of wines to the U.S. or anyone else. Find something you like in Chi-town and enjoy."}
