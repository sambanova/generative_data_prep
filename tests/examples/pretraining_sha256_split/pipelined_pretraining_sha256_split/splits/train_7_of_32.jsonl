{"prompt": "", "completion": "Sony\u2019s first 3D TV is finally here, in the 40in shape of the KDL-40HX803. And to be honest, we\u2019re not expecting very much. For whenever we\u2019ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven\u2019t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let\u2019s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!\nRather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t wear Sony\u2019s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.\nIt doesn\u2019t do the 40HX803\u2018s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it\u2019s nothing like as slim as Samsung\u2019s edge LED icons. What\u2019s more, its edge LED system is a dynamic one, meaning that sections of the edge lighting can be independently controlled for a hopefully more impressive contrast performance than you usually get with a standard edge LED-lit LCD TV.\nSlightly surprisingly for such a slim screen, Sony has left most of its connections facing straight out of the TV\u2019s rear, rather than using the side access approach that would suit wall hanging. But at least the number and variety of these connections is pretty prodigious.\nFor instance, it has four HDMIs, all built to the v1.4 specification, so that they\u2019re compatible with 3D sources. Also of note are a USB input, an Ethernet port, and a 3D Sync terminal, which we\u2019ll look at in turn.\nThe USB can play music, video and photo files directly into the TV, but also allows you to add Wi-Fi to the 40HX803 via an optional USB dongle. It\u2019s a touch disappointing that the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t carry built-in Wi-Fi for its money, but it\u2019s hardly alone in preferring the optional upgrade route.\nThe Ethernet socket, meanwhile, has three uses. First, it supports the set\u2019s built-in Freeview HD tuner, to deliver potential future interactive services like the BBC iPlayer. Second, it provides a wired means of importing files stored on a DLNA PC. Finally, it allows you to take the TV online to experience Sony\u2019s Bravia Internet Video platform, which we\u2019ll return to in a minute.\nBut first we\u2019ve got to discuss the 3D Sync terminal. This is there because the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have a built-in 3D transmitter, unlike the Samsung and Panasonic 3D TVs we\u2019ve tested. In fact, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have 3D facilities at all in its standard form. You have to add an optional extra transmitter and optional pairs of active shutter glasses, with the transmitter costing \u00a350 and the glasses setting you back \u00a399 per pair. This effectively makes the 40HX803 \u00a31,887 if you want 3D with two pairs of glasses.\nWe do understand Sony\u2019s idea with this, to be fair. For it helps keep the 40HX803\u2019s up-front price down, allowing people to add 3D later as their finances allow. But there\u2019s no getting round the fact that once you\u2019ve 3Ded it up, the 40HX803 hits a similar price level to Samsung\u2019s 40C8000 integrated 3D TV. In other words, 3D continues to be very much a premium technology."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "I usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren\u2019t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you\u2019ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He\u2019s very well-trained.\nI think it\u2019s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry\u2019s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change\u2026I don\u2019t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.\nHenry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They\u2019re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he\u2019s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn\u2019t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry\u2019s growth has a greater impact on both of them.\nIt was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn\u2019t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He\u2019s very loving, but he\u2019s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin\u2019s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.\nI anticipate going a little deeper into Martin\u2019s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I\u2019ll present from Martin\u2019s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they\u2019re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I\u2019ve already covered from Henry\u2019s perspective to some extent, and when I\u2019m writing Henry, I\u2019m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.\nOffering Martin\u2019s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin\u2019s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I\u2019ve gotten the impression (whether it\u2019s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry\u2019s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin\u2019s perspective is a valuable addition."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Recently, I sat down to talk with a group of eight students from a large prominent church in Southern California. They were raised in the church. They were regulars at youth group. They claimed to be in relationship with Christ. Yet, they were dead. As I tried to engage them, most seemed unmoved and uninterested. And I was not surprised.\nAs I work with churches around the country, I encounter countless Christian students who are apathetic toward spiritual things. Their relationship with Christ is passionless. Talk of God is ho-hum. But why? Shouldn\u2019t our relationship with Christ be life\u2019s most exciting adventure? I\u2019m not suggesting the Christian life is one, big, emotional high, but why are students more willing to plug into their iPods than their Bibles? Why are they more excited about the latest celebrity gossip than the Gospel? Why aren\u2019t their lives filled with the drama of God\u2019s Kingdom?\nI think a big part of the problem is that Christian students rarely engage their world for the cause of Christ. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed in my training over the years. The most exciting events I do, the events where students seem to come to life, are those where there is some component of engagement. Let me illustrate.\nFor almost ten years now, I\u2019ve been taking students on mission trips to Berkeley and Utah. Each trip requires hours of training, typically in the form of classroom instruction and the reading of required books. This training is important and necessary, but it\u2019s not what generates the most buzz among the students. Students get fired up on the trip when we give them opportunities to engage non-believers.\nOn these trips we invite Mormon leaders, Unitarians, gay activists, Hare Krishna priests, skeptics, and atheists to dialogue with students. We give our non-Christian guests time to share their views, followed by a time of questions from our students. It\u2019s during Q&A when students really come to life. They ask question after question, graciously yet firmly force our skeptical guests to give a reason for their views. At the conclusion of each encounter, we thank our guests and then spend time debriefing. At this point, students are always abuzz, asking me question after question. Before I know it, an hour of discussing apologetics and theology with youth will have flown by.\nIn addition, we send our groups onto college campuses, like BYU or Berkeley, to conduct surveys. The surveys are designed to get our students into conversation with non-Christians students about spiritual issues. At first, students are fearful and anxious. They\u2019re skeptical about people\u2019s willingness to engage with them. But after an hour or two of surveys, students return and they are always pumped. During our debrief time, students can\u2019t wait to share about their encounters. They\u2019re filled with excitement about their conversations on campus with non-Christians.\nWhen we create opportunities for students to engage, there is a vibrancy that infuses the events. But this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Christianity is not a spectator sport. Our teaching should not remain in a classroom or behind the four walls of the church. If we want to train students who can defend the faith not just intelligently but passionately, we need to get them in the game. Think about any sports teams. It\u2019s the starters who are the most passionate about the game, right? The benchwarmers, not so much. I think that\u2019s one reason why our mission trips to Berkeley and Utah are exciting and successful. They get students in the game. They get students engaging a lost world with the truth of Jesus Christ.\nIn 2014, students will get a taste of being in the game as I take them to Berkeley and Utah. I\u2019ve already maxed out the number of mission trips I\u2019m capable of taking through July. Indeed, we\u2019ve had to turn groups away or ask them to start scheduling for 2015. So this year, we\u2019ll be getting students off the sidelines and igniting their fire for Christ. I can\u2019t wait."}
