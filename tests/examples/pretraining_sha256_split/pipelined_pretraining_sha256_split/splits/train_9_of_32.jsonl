{"prompt": "", "completion": "The EU is a political system with a unique structure and functioning, incomparable to anything which has existed before, far away from any classical, either national or international model. In such supranational union that is neither a pure intergovernmental organization nor a true federal state, political institutions appear vague and somewhat obscure and indistinguishable.\nAre Iran and Saudi Arabia going to war? They are already fighting \u2013 by proxy \u2013 all over the region. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran quickly deteriorated in January 2016 following Riyadh\u2019s execution of Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimi but their struggle for power dates back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. Tehran's influence extends today across a broad area of the Middle East from Iran in the east to Lebanon in the west.\nUNESCO\u2019s Director-General, Irina Bokova and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni signed in February 2016 in Rome an agreement on the establishment of a Task Force of cultural heritage experts in the framework of UNESCO\u2019s global coalition \u201cUnite for Heritage\u201d. Under the agreement, UNESCO will be able to ask the Italian Government to make experts of the Task Force available for deployment for the conservation of cultural heritage in areas affected by crises.\nIn October 2016 John Sawers, a former MI6 chief, told BBC that the world was entering an era possibly \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the Cold War, as \u201cwe do not have that focus on a strategic relationship between Moscow and Washington\u201d.\nLt. Gen. Eugeny Buzhinsky, head of PIR Centre, a Moscow Think Tank, did maintain: \u201cIf we talk about the last Cold War, we are currently somewhere between the erection of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis but without the mechanisms to manage the confrontation\u201d."}

They can be easily modified to serve a range of purposes, are potentially eye-catching if they are placed in the appropriate area and are a good way of promoting a specific product or offer on a homepage while also retaining the core brand visuals elsewhere.\nThe image below is an example of a web banner in development. We\u2019ve put together a handy guide for creating your banners \u2013 click here.\nNew features on your e-commerce website can add value through improved functionality, which in turn enhances the usability for customers and users. Features that allow for easy modification to products that they wish to purchase, such as different colours or quantities, or a social login function that enables users to create an account through their Facebook credentials.\nSuch responsive features make the e-commerce process as painless and easy-to-use as possible, limiting the barriers between browsing and purchase, in turn improving conversion rates and the chances of customers returning for more in the future.\nA positive experience can often leave the customer wanting more, and it\u2019s the websites job to ensure that their features and functionality are kept updated and fit for purpose, in response to the ever-changing demands of the modern e-commerce customer.\nFor example, one of the new features we\u2019ve recently added from Amasty is the Social Login, which allows users to set up their account using login credentials from Facebook. To find out more about this feature, click here.\nWhile you\u2019re reading this, grab a smartphone or tablet and have a browse around your website.\nAre the images stacked or overlapping, or is there text missing?\nThese issues mean your website has not been optimised for mobile devices, making it unusable for a large percentage of potential customers browsing with their iPhones or Samsungs. Users are extremely unlikely to want to fight through images and texts to find the products they want, and will quickly become frustrated and depart for a different site.\nDon\u2019t neglect these customers! Get your site optimised for different devices to reach as wide an audience as possible.\nData from 2018, shown below in the graph, from Statista.com, shows that 52.2% of all browsing online was done on a mobile device, a trend which has grown exponentially year-upon-year. This graph underlines the importance of ensuring that your website is fit for use for all potential users. You\u2019re potentially missing out on reaching these customers if your site doesn\u2019t meet their demands, and, with the trend of mobile browsing only set to rise, optimising your website to ensure it\u2019s fit for use is quickly become a necessity for online retailers.\nOur Liquidshop e-commerce platform is designed to provide the best user experience for your customers, though responsive e-commerce. Optimisation on devices of all sizes allows your website to be user-friendly for as many potential visitors as possible, expanding your reach and enhancing the user experience, leading to increased sales as part of the smooth and responsive overall e-commerce experience.\nThere are few things more off-putting when navigating onto an e-commerce website that a poorly designed logo at the top of the page, or old, pixilated imagery taking up the homepage. A consistent brand image across the pages improves brand recognition for customers and gives the impression of a modern, well designed and cared for website and business as a whole.\nYou can also create special themed logos for holiday times such as Christmas or winter, like we did with our logo below.\nWhat\u2019s most important is too put time and effort into keeping your website updated. Whether that\u2019s imagery, information or branding, putting the time into maintaining an attractive and cohesive e-commerce site means you keep your customers, and new visitors engaged and ensure that there as few barriers as possible between browsing and purchase."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "One of our memorials is missing a sword.\nThe General Sherman memorial just south of the Treasury Building shows General William Tecumseh Sherman on horseback atop a 32-foot pedestal guarded at each ground-level corner by a soldier. The memorial was designed by a Danish sculptor named Carl Rohl-Smith. It was dedicated on Oct. 15, 1903.\nThe northwest soldier is an infantryman, holding his rifle by the barrel, with the butt resting on the ground. The southwest soldier is an engineer, holding his rifle in the same position. He also carries a cylinder or tube, about 3 feet long. Perhaps it contains surveying instruments. The southeast soldier is a cavalryman, with sword pointed upward across his left shoulder. At the northeast is an artilleryman \u2014 whose hands close upon empty air.\nWhen I saw the northeast soldier, the question arose: Is he missing a rifle or a sword? Well, what would one of my heroes, Sherlock Holmes, do? Look for a cartridge box, or a scabbard.\nThere was a scabbard there, an empty one. So it was indeed a missing sword \u2014 a fact later verified in The Post\u2019s Oct. 16, 1903, edition, which included a drawing showing the soldier with a sword, its point touching the ground.\nThe lost sword is probably rusting in somebody\u2019s attic or slowly corroding in a landfill. I doubt even Holmes could find it now."}
