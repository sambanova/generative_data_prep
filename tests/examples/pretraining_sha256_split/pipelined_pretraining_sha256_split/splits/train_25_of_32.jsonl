{"prompt": "", "completion": "Those words (choice profanity included) woke me with a start the other night. What was I thinking, organizing this trip to Vietnam to connect sons and daughters who lost fathers on both sides of the Vietnam War?\nI have a lot of fears about this journey. There\u2019s the mundane ones about getting sick, or bitten by something slimy. Maybe I'll become separated from the group because something in a shop caught my eye (this, given my nature, is the most likely scenario). But the deeper fears are right under the surface. What\u2019s going to happen when we come face to face with the Vietnamese sons and daughters? Will they be angry? Worse, will I?\nIt was easy to push past these bigger fears earlier this year when I first formed the 2 Sides Project. Now the trip is getting closer\u2014we leave four weeks from today\u2014and they\u2019re keeping me up at night.\nI\u2019m going to have to remember what I know in the daylight: there have been moments in my life when I\u2019ve found people who shared my experience, who spoke the same language as me, who felt the same way I did about things. These moments are profound. They make me feel connected, anchored in the world. They are often turning points that lead me to a better place.\nThat was the case when I met other sons and daughters in the U.S. who lost fathers in the war. So, I\u2019ll keep my focus on them. And on the amazing experience we have in store. Six of us will be meeting Vietnamese sons and daughters and visiting the sites where our fathers died. I\u2019ll profile them all -- Mike, Ron, Margaret, Susan and Patty -- here in the coming weeks as we get ready. Come with us virtually. It\u2019s going to be quite a journey, and we\u2019re looking forward to sharing it with you."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "San Francisco is a city of rich history and culture, and as anyone planning a visit to the City by the Bay realizes, it can be difficult to narrow down all the places to visit and thing to do while there. Aside from the usual tourist spots like the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco also offers historic architecture on nearly every corner, a serene Japanese Tea Gardens, the glorious Golden Gate Park, alongside countless cultural and artistic institutions.
