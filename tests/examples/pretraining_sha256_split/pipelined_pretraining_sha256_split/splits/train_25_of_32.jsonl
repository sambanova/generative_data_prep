{"prompt": "", "completion": "When Rudy Gay left the game with a left knee injury late in the first quarter, memories of the Sacramento Kings\u2019 (16-22) recent poor play minus a star resurfaced. The thought came to fruition as DeMarcus Cousins joined him on the sidelines in the waning seconds of regulation, and the short-handed Kings fell to the visiting Dallas Mavericks (27-12), 108-104.\nThe Kings are currently 2-2 on their six-game home stand and return to action on Friday in a contest against the Miami Heat. Join Cowbell Kingdom\u2019sJames Ham as he recaps the action from the floor of Sleep Train Arena.\n1. Can the Kings win without DeMarcus Cousins?\nThe Kings are 0-7 without their starting center and it looks like Cousins will miss another game on Wednesday with a strained left hip flexor. Andrew Bogut is questionable for the Warrior with left shoulder inflammation, as is reserve Jermaine O\u2019Neal (sore back). This game might turn into a track meet, which doesn\u2019t bode well for Sacramento.\n2. Can the Kings defend the 3-point line?\nSacramento ranks 28th in the league against the long ball. The Warriors starting backcourt of Curry and Thompson have already shot close to 800 3-pointers on the season. If the Kings don\u2019t stay with Golden State\u2019s shooters, they have very little chance of pulling off the upset.\n3. How do the Kings players handle the trade rumors?\nThe trade deadline is 12pm PST on Thursday and the rumors are swirling. Do the Kings players crumble under the pressure or do they come out swinging in what might be their last game in Sacramento?\nAccording to an NBA source, Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas underwent an MRI earlier Tuesday on his left wrist. Counter to other media reports, the results of the tests were negative and Thomas is not expected to miss any time with the injury.\nSince taking over the starting position 35 games ago, Thomas is averaging 21.5 points, 6.9 assists and 1.3 steals per game in 37.5 minutes. But rumors that he was having some discomfort in his wrist began a few weeks back.\nRecently, his shooting numbers have taken a dramatic dip, beginning in January when he shot just 41.2 percent from the field and 32.7 percent from long range. Thomas\u2019s overall field goal percentage has bounced back in the month of February, but his 3-point percentage for the seven games this month is 24.1 percent.\nThomas and rookie guard Ben McLemore were the subject of a trade rumor on Monday, but coach Michael Malone and general manager Pete D\u2019Alessandro refuted the reports following practice on Tuesday afternoon.\nWith injuries and possible trade rumors swirling, it should be a wild couple of days in Sacramento.\nThomas wasn\u2019t the only Kings player to undergo an MRI today. For the second straight day, center DeMarcus Cousins made a trip to the doctors office for testing. Results of the first MRI were inconclusive, but a second test confirmed the Kings medical staff\u2019s earlier diagnosis of a strained left hip flexor.\nCousins has been unable to participate in practice since returning from the All-Star break. He is listed as day-to-day, but considered doubtful for Wednesday\u2019s match-up against the Golden State Warriors.\nHamady Ndiaye out of Rutgers and DeQuan Jones out of Florida are the only late additions. Ndiaye was in camp last season with Sacramento and left a solid impression. After being waived by the Kings, the 26-year old center spent last season playing for Tianjin Ronggang Golden Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association.\nJones played in 63 games last season with the Orlando Magic, including 17 starts. He averaged 3.7 points per game in a little under 13 minutes a game.\nLast season it was high ropes courses in Colorado Springs, Co. This year, the Sacramento Kings open training camp away from home again, but instead of the Team USA practice facility in Colorado, it will be on the sandy beaches of Santa Barbara, CA. Camp will run from Oct. 1-6 at the Pavilion Gym on the University of California, Santa Barbara campus.\nThe team will head back to Northern California for their pre-season opener on the road against the Golden State Warriors on October 7, before heading to Las Vegas to take on the Lakers on Oct. 10.\nAfter the initial week away, the Kings will continue camp in Sacramento at the team\u2019s practice facility in Natomas.\nCowbell Kingdom has grown exponentially since its founding in 2009 and we want to make sure we know our audience.

However, those who follow the Kings closely know just how valuable Thornton is, especially his competition.\n\u201cHe\u2019s become an outstanding scorer in this league,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks guard Darren Collisonback in January of his former New Orleans Hornets teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely made a niche in this league as far as (being) a big time scorer.\nIn their rookie year, Collison and Thornton formed an explosive and exciting young backcourt for the Hornets. Though they\u2019ve since gone their separate ways, the two remain close. Thornton worked out last offseason with Collison in Los Angeles during the lockout.\nThe fourth-year guard out of UCLA thinks Sacramento is a good fit for his old teammate. He believes Thornton will only continue to improve with the Kings\u2019 green nucleus.\nAveraging 18.7 points per game, Thornton led the Kings in scoring last season and usually found himself as their go-to-guy in clutch situations. The next step for Thornton, according to another former teammate, is becoming an accomplished defender.\nAs explosive as he is with the ball, Thornton could stand to see some improvement on the defensive end. The Louisiana native finished in the bottom three among his 15 teammates in defensive rating.\nHowever like Collison, West thinks Thornton will continue to find success in the league.\nThe Kings may not belong to Marcus Thornton. But his importance to their success isn\u2019t an understatement.\nTwenty-five years ago today, Sacramento Kings Head Coach Keith Smart hit a shot that changed his life forever.\nNo matter where I go, people talk about it. Once they recognize me or see a nametag on my bag or something like that, they start talking about \u201cThe Shot\u201d. So it\u2019s a great moment and I\u2019m glad it went in, but wasn\u2019t just something for me.\nWe just had our 25 year championship reunion. And we all got together and it wasn\u2019t so much what we all did in the tournament and our careers. It was a friendship and a relationship that we have now that that moment brings us all together.\nDiehard Sacramento Kings fan Kevin Fippin wanted to propose to his long-time girlfriend Lydia Nicolaisen. So before he popped the question on New Year\u2019s Eve, he recruited the services of a Sacramento Kings fan favorite."}

Architect, artist, furniture designer, and educator, Ralph Rapson has played a leading role in the development and practice of modern architecture and design, both nationally and internationally.\nRalph Rapson: Sixty Years of Modern Design, by Rip Rapson, Jane King Hession and Bruce N.

(He had his students hoist famous visitors upside down, including the stocky Buckminister Fuller, and footprint the ceiling with their bare soles.) The book shows how one can be talented, influential and happy, all the while remaining internationally obscure. It also tells, discreetly, how one man can achieve all this single-handedly: with his right forearm amputated at birth, Ralph Rapson drew with his left hand."}
