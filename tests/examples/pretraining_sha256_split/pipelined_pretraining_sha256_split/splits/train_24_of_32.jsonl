{"prompt": "", "completion": "College or work? Gap year or victory lap? And how should a young person choose among the multitude of programs offered through universities, colleges or a combination of both?\nThose are just some of the questions faced by today\u2019s high school graduates.\nIn an era of tough competition for jobs, the rise of precarious employment and the disappearance of a linear path from school to work, teaching kids career and life planning is more important than ever.\nBut a new report from People for Education says Ontario students aren\u2019t getting what they need from the province\u2019s careers strategy, introduced over a three-year period beginning in 2013.\nPrincipals surveyed by the research and advocacy group cited problems implementing the plan, a shortage of guidance counsellors and lack of teacher training to help students at all levels.\nSo helping them understand themselves and their interests even as young students is key to making sure they have the tools to navigate a complex path.\nThe Ontario strategy includes such mandatory components as: portfolios for every student from kindergarten to Grade 12 to help them reflect on their interests, strengths, learning and later career possibilities; career and life-planning committees in every school; and professional development for teachers to help them integrate career and life planning into the classroom.\nIt is also linked to the existing 40 hours of mandatory community volunteering for high school students and the compulsory Grade 10 careers course.\nMandatory career and life-planning committees were in place in only 15 per cent of elementary schools and 39 per cent of high schools. And of those, only 8 per cent of secondary schools included community members.\nThirty-four per cent of elementary and 56 per cent of secondary schools reported that every student had a career/life-planning portfolio.\nTeacher training on career and life planning was available at fewer than one in four elementary schools and 40 per cent of high schools.\nWhile high school guidance counsellors are the primary staff members responsible for student portfolios and planning, 16 per cent of secondary schools don\u2019t have a full-time guidance counsellor.\nThe average ratio is one counsellor for every 380 students \u2014 in line with what provincial funding provides \u2014 but one in 10 schools struggles with a ratio of 600 students per teacher.\nPrincipals said two years of education labour disputes interfered with the new strategy, but also blamed lack of technology support, workload issues, and a lack of overall understanding of the policy.\n\u201cWhile lots of them talked about how great the policy was, an equal number talked about how difficult it was to implement,\u201d says Kidder.\nShe cited \u201cinitiative exhaustion\u201d among teachers and administrators following a stream of new education strategies ranging from math to well-being to experiential learning, which can leave staff overwhelmed. And she called for better integration of the career and life lessons with all school subjects.\nFor Bruce Lawson of the Counselling Foundation of Canada, making the most of the provincial strategy is key. And he says despite the challenges addressed in the report, it is one of the best in the country.\nBy the time today\u2019s elementary students graduate, at least one third of the occupations open to them will be jobs that don\u2019t currently exist, says Lawson, president of the foundation, which promotes career planning and development. For kindergarten students, it amounts to more than half.\nOur editors found this article on this site using Google and regenerated it for our readers."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "2019 is here, and the new year provides an excellent opportunity to refresh your e-commerce website, by adding new features and updating content.\nWeb banners are a great way to keep your e-commerce website homepage looking fresh, and making viewers aware of the latest news about products and offers. They can be easily modified to serve a range of purposes, are potentially eye-catching if they are placed in the appropriate area and are a good way of promoting a specific product or offer on a homepage while also retaining the core brand visuals elsewhere.\nThe image below is an example of a web banner in development. We\u2019ve put together a handy guide for creating your banners \u2013 click here.\nNew features on your e-commerce website can add value through improved functionality, which in turn enhances the usability for customers and users. Features that allow for easy modification to products that they wish to purchase, such as different colours or quantities, or a social login function that enables users to create an account through their Facebook credentials.\nSuch responsive features make the e-commerce process as painless and easy-to-use as possible, limiting the barriers between browsing and purchase, in turn improving conversion rates and the chances of customers returning for more in the future.\nA positive experience can often leave the customer wanting more, and it\u2019s the websites job to ensure that their features and functionality are kept updated and fit for purpose, in response to the ever-changing demands of the modern e-commerce customer.\nFor example, one of the new features we\u2019ve recently added from Amasty is the Social Login, which allows users to set up their account using login credentials from Facebook. To find out more about this feature, click here.\nWhile you\u2019re reading this, grab a smartphone or tablet and have a browse around your website.\nAre the images stacked or overlapping, or is there text missing?\nThese issues mean your website has not been optimised for mobile devices, making it unusable for a large percentage of potential customers browsing with their iPhones or Samsungs. Users are extremely unlikely to want to fight through images and texts to find the products they want, and will quickly become frustrated and depart for a different site.\nDon\u2019t neglect these customers! Get your site optimised for different devices to reach as wide an audience as possible.\nData from 2018, shown below in the graph, from Statista.com, shows that 52.2% of all browsing online was done on a mobile device, a trend which has grown exponentially year-upon-year. This graph underlines the importance of ensuring that your website is fit for use for all potential users. You\u2019re potentially missing out on reaching these customers if your site doesn\u2019t meet their demands, and, with the trend of mobile browsing only set to rise, optimising your website to ensure it\u2019s fit for use is quickly become a necessity for online retailers.\nOur Liquidshop e-commerce platform is designed to provide the best user experience for your customers, though responsive e-commerce. Optimisation on devices of all sizes allows your website to be user-friendly for as many potential visitors as possible, expanding your reach and enhancing the user experience, leading to increased sales as part of the smooth and responsive overall e-commerce experience.\nThere are few things more off-putting when navigating onto an e-commerce website that a poorly designed logo at the top of the page, or old, pixilated imagery taking up the homepage. A consistent brand image across the pages improves brand recognition for customers and gives the impression of a modern, well designed and cared for website and business as a whole.\nYou can also create special themed logos for holiday times such as Christmas or winter, like we did with our logo below.\nWhat\u2019s most important is too put time and effort into keeping your website updated. Whether that\u2019s imagery, information or branding, putting the time into maintaining an attractive and cohesive e-commerce site means you keep your customers, and new visitors engaged and ensure that there as few barriers as possible between browsing and purchase."}
