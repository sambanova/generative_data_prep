{"prompt": "", "completion": "Charles Dickens gave us so much. Including this.\nIn A Christmas Carol,when Ebenezer Scrooge is presented with the Ghost of Christmas Present, he finds the \"jolly Giant\" sitting in state on an enormous heap of roast meats and other traditional English Christmas delicacies and flanked by \"seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.\"\nCharles Dickens knew all about delicious steam.\nHe was a committed English traditionalist in his drinking. He didn't drink the international celebrity's customary champagne, champagne, and more champagne or the trendy drinks of his day \u2014 gin cocktails, claret cups, brandy smashes, or the like. Rather, his greatest affinity was for a drink that was fading faster and faster into the past by the time he came into fame. From 1700 to 1830, give or take a couple years on each end, the preeminent English social drink was the bowl of punch, a large-bore mixture of spirits (usually rum and cognac), citrus juice, sugar, water, and spice that was guaranteed to unite any gathering in jollity and boozy good cheer. But with the industrialization, commercialization, and urbanization of day-to-day life that the Victorian years brought, the convivial ritual of clustering around the flowing bowl became as quaint and outmoded as the tricorn hat.\nDickens, however, not only bucked the trend but made a whole performance out of bucking it. When he was among friends, it was his custom to brew up a bowl of punch, complete with a running disquisition on the techniques he was using and the ingredients he was deploying, thus adding instruction to delight (as one of his characters might say). Fortunately, in 1847, he wrote the whole procedure out for a friend's wife. It's not hard to follow, and there's no better way to get a holiday party started than by getting everybody involved in draining a bowl of punch. All it takes is a little preparation in advance, a willingness to hold forth a bit in front of your guests, and a high enough ceiling that you won't burn your house down. Dickens was never afraid to employ cheap sensationalism if it would help him get over, and there's nothing more sensational for selling a drink than setting it on fire. Here's our interpretation.\nStep 1: Three hours before your party, peel 3 lemons with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, trying to end up with three long spirals of peel. Put them in a 3- or 4-quart fireproof bowl with 3/4 cup demerara sugar or other raw sugar. Muddle the peels and the sugar together and let sit.\nTalking Points: One of the secrets of punch making is to use the fragrant, sweet oil that resides in lemon peels as the sugar extract. The resulting sugar-oil mix (\"oleo-saccharum\") adds body to the punch.\nTalking Points: The cognac is for body and smoothness, the strong rum for bouquet and (frankly) flammability, and the other rum for taming the strong one.\nStep 3: Set 1 quart water to boil and put the bowl containing the lemon peels and sugar on a wooden cutting board or other heat-resistant surface in a spot where everyone can gather around. When the water boils, turn it off, gather your guests around the bowl, and pour in the cognac and rum, noting what you're adding and why.\nStep 4: With a long-handled barspoon, remove a spoonful of the rum-cognac mixture and set it on fire. Return it to the bowl, using it to ignite the rest.\nStir with a ladle or long-handled spoon, attempting to dissolve the sugar. Let burn for 2 or 3 minutes, occasionally lifting one of the lemon peels up so people can admire the flames running down it.\nTalking Points: You're setting the punch alight not because it looks cool but to burn off some of the more volatile elements of the alcohol. That's the story, anyway.\nStep 6: Grate fresh nutmeg over the top and ladle out in 3-oz servings.\nEsquire participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "The entorhinal cortex receives a large projection from the piriform cortex, and synaptic plasticity in this pathway may affect olfactory processing. In vitro whole cell recordings have been used here to investigate postsynaptic signalling mechanisms that mediate the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in layer II entorhinal cortex cells. To induce LTD, pairs of pulses, using a 30-millisecond interval, were delivered at 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, consistent with a requirement for calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Induction of LTD was blocked when the FK506 was included in the intracellular solution to block the phosphatase calcineurin. Okadaic acid, which blocks activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, also prevented LTD.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Arguably Inferior Socket for Paladin PvE Gems for the most part, but Superior for PvP.A side-grade to t6, but an upgrade for almost anything pre-Sunwell.\nThis item, and all the other engineering helm upgrades, are sunwell trash drops.\nSo since people need to start farming the instance to begin with and there will be people in the raids who need it you probably won't see this on the AH for quite some time depending on the server.\nI wouldn't call this a side grade at all, considering that Sunwell requires paladins to spam Holy Light a lot more than Flash of Light, making their mana regen come mostly from Illumination/holy crit (great for pallies with the 2 piece t6 crit bonus to HL) and being in a group with a Shadow Priest. The upgrades here are where it matters most - a 20 crit increase over t6 (more than 1 % - thats fantastic in a single piece!) and plus 9 healing. Armor? lol - what are you going to do, tank in holy gear in Sunwell? You'll need the stam for the boss fights consdering the dots that Kalecgos does, for starters. Int doesnt matter so much since your mana regen and your +heal are really the major factors in post BT/MH content.\nMy server has pug groups for sunwell trush run. BoP/BoE recipes usually drops from 1 to 5 and lots of epic-stones. You do not have to wear BT/Hyjal geared, Kara/SSC/TK gears are fine for trush run.\nIt usually goes 4k-5k on my server. It is a good resource of money, and you can call ppl when your guild does not have scheduled raid. However, you will need 5-6 mages for trush run.\nDropped for me tonight on Garithos-US on the last pull before the first stairs in the instance.\nMy guild's been running Sunwell since 2.4 release and the patterns are extremely rare. We've only had 4 patterns drop, ever, and two of them were the Sunfire Robe (both dropped the day before this Schematic).\nI was seriously beginning to believe I'd never get my hands on this because of its extreme rarity. I'm reasonably certain it's the only Sunwell Schematic to have dropped on my server as of yet. I've been passing on T6 helms for months in hopes of getting this and was going to give in and pick one up this week, then this baby swooped in!\nCan only be learned by Paladins.\nCan I learn this Schematic as a Rogue ?\nYou can only learn this on a pally and it's supposed to only drop for pallies, but it dropped for my DK today (maybe since there were no DKs when Sunwell was released?) My engineer is a druid and cannot use it but I hope some Paladin buys it as the sell price looks pretty high."}
