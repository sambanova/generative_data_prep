{"prompt": "", "completion": "see how it would perform under real-world flexing, saving prototypes.\nTwo recent examples, one in the U.S. and one in the U.K., show the improvements and time/cost savings engineers have realized from their use of engineering software.\nIn Camberly, U.K., the design team at reseller Williams Medical Supplies set up a new technical development department to design medical products and settled on Solid Edge (UGS) as its core design tool. \u201cOur aim is to take a routine surgical instrument and bring something new to the design that will provide significant benefit,\u201d says Robert Steele, technical development director. Among their projects: the Opmaster Series 4 surgery operating table. The enhanced design allows a patient to be examined, operated on, and recover on the same table.\nThe result was a major time savings, largely the result of not doing many prototypes. \u201cIn fact, we were almost able to dispense with the prototyping phase and go straight to manufacturing,\u201d Steele asserts.\nWorking with different software and on a vastly different product line, engineers at San Diego-based Tensys Medical, Inc. had similar results.\nUsing SolidWorks for CAD and COSMOSWorks for FEA (both from Dassault Systemes, Inc.) the engineering team developed the T-Line[R] Tensymeter, a non-invasive arterial blood-pressure management system for use in surgery. Their goal was to replace the traditional cuff-based monitors that provide only intermittent measurements every few minutes. That kind of irregular monitoring can delay recognition of rapid changes in blood pressure.\nThe design concept uses an actuator to move a sensor over the patient\u2019s wrist to find the best position for producing a continuous waveform. \u201cThe sensor has to float within a rigid frame attached to a serpentine arm that\u2019s designed to flex. The team used COSMOSWORKS to identify areas of high stress for the olefin-based serpentine arm and used the analysis results to make design modifications.\nAmong those modifications, says Senior Engineer Russ Hempstead: \u201cWe removed the stress risers, added radii, and added thickening sections.\u201d He and the engineering team didn\u2019t expect to see the stress risers, but when they did they put static flexing on part of the serpentine arm so they could move it the way it would move in the real world. The software enabled the team to shorten the design cycle by 60 percent. They cut manufacturing time by four percent, material costs by three percent, and labor costs by three-four percent. In all, engineers did seven or eight analysis studies in just a couple of days.\nIndustrial workplaces are governed by OSHA rules, but this isn\u2019t to say that rules are always followed. While injuries happen on production floors for a variety of reasons, of the top 10 OSHA rules that are most often ignored in industrial settings, two directly involve machine design: lockout/tagout procedures (LO/TO) and machine guarding.\nFocus on Fundamentals consists of 45-minute on-line classes that cover a host of technologies.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "How can I teach my toddler to do things independently?\nYou\u2019ve probably become more patient since you started this whole parenthood thing. And you\u2019re going to have to practice patience even more as your toddler learns to become more independent.\nFor example, she tells you she can\u2019t finish the puzzle she\u2019s doing. Instead of jumping right in and telling her which piece goes where, you\u2019re going to have to tell her you\u2019ll help a little. Go ahead and help, but let her do a lot of it herself, and make sure she\u2019s the one to finish the job. That will give her a sense of accomplishment and the confidence to try again next time.\nRemember that children each progress at their own rate. It\u2019s not always fast \u2014 and there will be setbacks along the way. But the more you can allow them to do on their own without stepping in, the more they\u2019ll be likely to try for themselves again and again."}
