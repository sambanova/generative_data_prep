{"prompt": "", "completion": "Those words (choice profanity included) woke me with a start the other night. What was I thinking, organizing this trip to Vietnam to connect sons and daughters who lost fathers on both sides of the Vietnam War?\nI have a lot of fears about this journey. There\u2019s the mundane ones about getting sick, or bitten by something slimy. Maybe I'll become separated from the group because something in a shop caught my eye (this, given my nature, is the most likely scenario). But the deeper fears are right under the surface. What\u2019s going to happen when we come face to face with the Vietnamese sons and daughters? Will they be angry? Worse, will I?\nIt was easy to push past these bigger fears earlier this year when I first formed the 2 Sides Project. Now the trip is getting closer\u2014we leave four weeks from today\u2014and they\u2019re keeping me up at night.\nI\u2019m going to have to remember what I know in the daylight: there have been moments in my life when I\u2019ve found people who shared my experience, who spoke the same language as me, who felt the same way I did about things. These moments are profound. They make me feel connected, anchored in the world. They are often turning points that lead me to a better place.\nThat was the case when I met other sons and daughters in the U.S. who lost fathers in the war. So, I\u2019ll keep my focus on them. And on the amazing experience we have in store. Six of us will be meeting Vietnamese sons and daughters and visiting the sites where our fathers died. I\u2019ll profile them all -- Mike, Ron, Margaret, Susan and Patty -- here in the coming weeks as we get ready. Come with us virtually. It\u2019s going to be quite a journey, and we\u2019re looking forward to sharing it with you."}

Warranty for this item is 90 days as with all B Grade items.\nB Grade items may have been used, have damaged packaging, missing accessories or a combination of these.\nSome items may have scuff marks or slight scratches but should otherwise be an operable product.\nRenowned for producing some of the world best CPU coolers, Zalman have now released their newest flagship cooler, the CNPS12X. It is the world's first \"out of the box\" triple fan cooler and is compatible with Intel latest LGA2011 Sandy Bridge E processors.\nWorlds first \"out of the box\" triple fan CPU coolerThere are many CPU coolers available on the market that can accommodate three fans, but to make this happen at least one additional fan needs to be purchased which add to the expense. With the Zalman CNPS12X you get three 120mm blue LED fans built into the cooler so there is no extra costs. Also all three fans run off one fan header, making powering the fans extremely easy.\nSix W-DTH composite heatpipes for excellent heat transferFirst seen on the CNPS11X, composite heatpipes help transfer the heat from the CPU up to 50% faster than standard heatpipes. This helps to increase the performance of the cooler even further. The six heatpipes are U-shaped, which effectively double the heat transfer compared to none U-shaped heatpipes.At the base of the cooler (where the heatpipes make contact with the CPU) the heatpipes utilise what Zalman call Whole-Direct Touch Heatpipes (W-DTH). This allows the heatpipes to make direct contact with the CPU, another feature to help increase performance. But not only that, the area of the Direct Touch will cover the whole CPU. Even the new Intel CPUs for LGA2011 will also be covered by W-DTH.\n100% nickel plated with blue LED fans for amazing aestheticsMost CPU coolers are hidden inside the computer case where they go about their business unseen. But if you like to show off the internals of the PC you may want a CPU cooler than looks the part, and boy the CNPS12X does look the part!The entire heatsink of CNPS12X is plated with \"Black-Pearl\" nickel for a long-term corrosion resistance, while the deep \"Black-Pearl\" tone, along with the high intensity from the blue LED fans helps this cooler stand head and shoulders above the rest."}
