It was a wonderful day for Susy and Geno and for their solid fans club. After long years of waiting, the two best friends shared a long and warm embrace.\nCheck out this YouTube video dance performance from Susy and Geno!\nThe two gladly gave a dance number people requested for. Afterwards, the pair mingled with the crowd where the latter grab the chance to take photos with them.\nThe reunion was also the first public appearance in many years for the faces of Sustagen Milk in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, who disappeared from the public eye, only to re-emerge two decades later, starting with Susy\u2019s return last February. Only then would we find out that she and Geno had actually lost touch through the years.\nMeanwhile, Susy and Geno\u2019s friends from Sustagen also did their part, providing free milk for all guests and fans.\nIt was a lovely day for Susy and Geno and for their loyal supporters.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Sony\u2019s first 3D TV is finally here, in the 40in shape of the KDL-40HX803. And to be honest, we\u2019re not expecting very much. For whenever we\u2019ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven\u2019t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let\u2019s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!\nRather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t wear Sony\u2019s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.\nIt doesn\u2019t do the 40HX803\u2018s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it\u2019s nothing like as slim as Samsung\u2019s edge LED icons. What\u2019s more, its edge LED system is a dynamic one, meaning that sections of the edge lighting can be independently controlled for a hopefully more impressive contrast performance than you usually get with a standard edge LED-lit LCD TV.\nSlightly surprisingly for such a slim screen, Sony has left most of its connections facing straight out of the TV\u2019s rear, rather than using the side access approach that would suit wall hanging. But at least the number and variety of these connections is pretty prodigious.\nFor instance, it has four HDMIs, all built to the v1.4 specification, so that they\u2019re compatible with 3D sources. Also of note are a USB input, an Ethernet port, and a 3D Sync terminal, which we\u2019ll look at in turn.\nThe USB can play music, video and photo files directly into the TV, but also allows you to add Wi-Fi to the 40HX803 via an optional USB dongle. It\u2019s a touch disappointing that the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t carry built-in Wi-Fi for its money, but it\u2019s hardly alone in preferring the optional upgrade route.\nThe Ethernet socket, meanwhile, has three uses. First, it supports the set\u2019s built-in Freeview HD tuner, to deliver potential future interactive services like the BBC iPlayer. Second, it provides a wired means of importing files stored on a DLNA PC. Finally, it allows you to take the TV online to experience Sony\u2019s Bravia Internet Video platform, which we\u2019ll return to in a minute.\nBut first we\u2019ve got to discuss the 3D Sync terminal. This is there because the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have a built-in 3D transmitter, unlike the Samsung and Panasonic 3D TVs we\u2019ve tested. In fact, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have 3D facilities at all in its standard form. You have to add an optional extra transmitter and optional pairs of active shutter glasses, with the transmitter costing \u00a350 and the glasses setting you back \u00a399 per pair. This effectively makes the 40HX803 \u00a31,887 if you want 3D with two pairs of glasses.\nWe do understand Sony\u2019s idea with this, to be fair. For it helps keep the 40HX803\u2019s up-front price down, allowing people to add 3D later as their finances allow. But there\u2019s no getting round the fact that once you\u2019ve 3Ded it up, the 40HX803 hits a similar price level to Samsung\u2019s 40C8000 integrated 3D TV. In other words, 3D continues to be very much a premium technology."}
