{"prompt": "", "completion": "Freshman Sen. David Carlucci, one of 17 Senate Democrats who received campaign contributions from Sen. Carl Kruger during the 2010 election cycle, is getting rid of that money after learning of the federal corruption charges lodged against his colleague earlier today.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that these types of allegations have clouded the legislature, tainting the hard working men and women who work diligently and honorably to serve their constituents,\u201d Carlucci said in a statement.\nAll told, Kruger, a prodigious fundraiser who had close to $1.9 million in his campaign committee, \u201cFriends of Carl,\u201d as of Jan. 15, doled out $49,000 to fellow senators this cycle, according to campaign finance records on file at the state Board of Elections. He also gave $450,000 to the DSCC.\nSen. Gustavo Rivera, who received $2,500 from Kruger, was the first lawmaker to announce he would divest himself of the scandal-scarred Brooklyn lawmaker\u2019s contributions. Now, apparently, all four of the Independent Democratic Conference members \u2013 Carlucci, Diane Savino, Jeff Klein, and Dave Valesky \u2013 are following suit."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "One of our memorials is missing a sword.\nThe General Sherman memorial just south of the Treasury Building shows General William Tecumseh Sherman on horseback atop a 32-foot pedestal guarded at each ground-level corner by a soldier. The memorial was designed by a Danish sculptor named Carl Rohl-Smith. It was dedicated on Oct. 15, 1903.\nThe northwest soldier is an infantryman, holding his rifle by the barrel, with the butt resting on the ground. The southwest soldier is an engineer, holding his rifle in the same position. He also carries a cylinder or tube, about 3 feet long. Perhaps it contains surveying instruments. The southeast soldier is a cavalryman, with sword pointed upward across his left shoulder. At the northeast is an artilleryman \u2014 whose hands close upon empty air.\nWhen I saw the northeast soldier, the question arose: Is he missing a rifle or a sword? Well, what would one of my heroes, Sherlock Holmes, do? Look for a cartridge box, or a scabbard.\nThere was a scabbard there, an empty one. So it was indeed a missing sword \u2014 a fact later verified in The Post\u2019s Oct. 16, 1903, edition, which included a drawing showing the soldier with a sword, its point touching the ground.\nThe lost sword is probably rusting in somebody\u2019s attic or slowly corroding in a landfill. I doubt even Holmes could find it now."}
