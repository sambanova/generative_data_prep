{"prompt": "", "completion": "The terrifying 38-minute ordeal suffered by Hawaii residents on Saturday, when the state\u2019s emergency-management agency sent out a false alert warning of an imminent ballistic-missile strike amid rising tensions with North Korea, seems to have sparked an unusually rapid response on Capitol Hill.\nHawaii\u2019s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don\u2019t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.\nInitial reports indicate that Hawaii\u2019s screwup\u2014which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later\u2014was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.\nOn Wednesday, Schatz said he had convened a phone call with officials from the Federal Communications Commission, the Homeland Security Department, the Pentagon, and other relevant agencies to address the inconsistency.\nThe way America\u2019s missile-alert system operates is fundamentally different from how citizens are alerted to most other catastrophes, when local authorities often possess the best information. While states and cities are ultimately responsible for alerting civilians of an imminent attack, they lack the ability to detect and track incoming missiles.\nIn the seconds and minutes after a launch, details of the threat would have to cascade through phone calls from the Pentagon to DHS. From there, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would send the warning to at-risk states and localities, whose own alert systems would only then spring into life.\nThat chain of causation was disrupted on Saturday. But David Simpson, a former admiral in the U.S. Navy who ran the FCC\u2019s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau from November 2013 to January 2017, said federal legislation should seek to dismantle that outdated process altogether.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a 1950s kind of structure,\u201d Simpson said, arguing that machine-to-machine communication technology should be utilized to eliminate lag time and cut down on human error.\nOne way to do that could be for the FCC to create, at the direction of Congress, a unique wireless-alert category for ballistic-missile threats. \u201cThat would then ensure that the machine elements of this system could be built around that narrow bucket,\u201d Simpson said.\nBut that still wouldn\u2019t solve the problem entirely. \u201cThe machine-to-machine piece of that, so it could be really useful, would require DHS and [Defense Department] plumbing changes that would be beyond the authorities of the FCC,\u201d Simpson said.\nSimpson largely endorsed Schatz\u2019s plan for a uniform federal missile-alert framework that states and localities can follow. \u201cThere\u2019s over 1,000 alert originators at the state and local level, and I would say five, six, seven vendors for the user-interface systems,\u201d he said.\nIn a bid to improve innovation, DHS gave state governments broad leeway to design their own missile-alert interfaces. But Simpson said that decision has clearly come with a cost.\nHouse Republicans are further along than their Senate counterparts, with plans to hold an Energy and Commerce hearing on Hawaii\u2019s false missile alert in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, committee chairman Greg Walden said he would be \u201chappy to work\u201d with Schatz on legislation, if needed. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got into the weeds on it,\u201d Walden said.\nAs long as lawmakers can work out issues surrounding committee and agency jurisdiction, Simpson said the chances for bipartisan support are high. But stakeholders from Homeland Security and the Pentagon\u2014as well as the congressional committees that oversee them\u2014will also need to weigh in. And Simpson worries those agencies may be loath to take responsibility for what\u2019s widely viewed as a state-level mistake.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect bipartisan issue, as long as we don\u2019t let the various lobbies and the competition between agencies pervert and potentially dilute the ultimate outcome,\u201d Simpson said.\n\"Two more House Republicans have joined the discharge petition to force votes on immigration, potentially leaving centrists just two signatures short of success. Reps. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) signed the discharge petition Thursday before the House left town for the Memorial Day recess. If all Democrats endorse the petition, just two more GOP signatures would be needed to reach the magic number of 218.\"\n\"A missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014 was fired from a launcher belonging to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, investigators said Thursday. The announcement is the first time the investigative team has identified a specific division of the Russian military as possibly being involved in the strike. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the incident.\"\n\"House Republicans are preparing to conduct the first interviews in over four months in their investigation into the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email probe. A joint investigation run by the Judiciary and Oversight Committees has set three witness interviews for June, including testimony from Bill Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division, and Michael Steinbach, the former head of the FBI\u2019s national security division.\"\n\"The White House confirmed Wednesday it is planning for a bipartisan group of House and Senate leaders, known as the 'Gang of 8,' to receive a highly-classified intelligence briefing on the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling, reversing plans to exclude Democrats altogether. ABC News first reported the plans to hold a separate briefing for Democrats, citing multiple administration and congressional sources. While details of the bipartisan meeting are still being worked out, a Republican-only briefing will go on as scheduled Thursday.\""}

With the Zalman CNPS12X you get three 120mm blue LED fans built into the cooler so there is no extra costs. Also all three fans run off one fan header, making powering the fans extremely easy.\nSix W-DTH composite heatpipes for excellent heat transferFirst seen on the CNPS11X, composite heatpipes help transfer the heat from the CPU up to 50% faster than standard heatpipes. This helps to increase the performance of the cooler even further. The six heatpipes are U-shaped, which effectively double the heat transfer compared to none U-shaped heatpipes.At the base of the cooler (where the heatpipes make contact with the CPU) the heatpipes utilise what Zalman call Whole-Direct Touch Heatpipes (W-DTH). This allows the heatpipes to make direct contact with the CPU, another feature to help increase performance. But not only that, the area of the Direct Touch will cover the whole CPU. Even the new Intel CPUs for LGA2011 will also be covered by W-DTH.\n100% nickel plated with blue LED fans for amazing aestheticsMost CPU coolers are hidden inside the computer case where they go about their business unseen.

Join the discussion as he analyzes the latest developments.\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative are teaming up on a new research-and-development initiative aimed at identifying \"state-of-the-art\" educational strategies and bringing them to the classroom.\nThe focus is on spurring development of new measures, new ways of teaching, and new technologies for tracking and supporting students' writing ability, math skills, and \"executive functions,\" such as self-control and attention.\nIn a new Request for Information released today, the groups wrote that researchers from fields as diverse as education, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and technology are generating exciting new ideas about how people actually learn\u2014but that information \"has not yet been translated effectively into methods and tools for teachers and students to use in the classroom every day.\"\nSuch \"research insights must inform ongoing development of tools and instructional approaches that will enable students to overcome math, literacy, and other learning challenges and at scale, in order to reach millions, if not billions, of students,\" the document reads.\nImproving students' writing (especially non-fiction).\"The skills connected to writing\u2014evaluation of arguments and evidence, critical and creative thinking about solutions and sources, identifying support for a key idea or process, clear and evocative argument-making\u2014are frequently cited as 21st century skills in high demand by employers,\" the Request for Information states. \"Yet, the majority of high school graduates are not prepared for the demands of postsecondary and workplace writing.\"\nAmong the areas where the groups hope to see improvements: comprehensive writing solutions, new metrics for measuring student progress and proficiency in writing, and new tools to promote more collaboration and better feedback.\nImproving students' mathematical understanding, application, and related mindsets.Here, the language of the personalized-learning movement (which both organizations support) is clear: There already exist promising approaches that \"help teachers to address individual students' needs by mirroring the same personalized approaches used by the best 1:1 tutors,\" the document states. \"Highly personalized learning experiences and tools have the potential to analyze student responses to understand barriers to student learning, provide immediate feedback, and apply immediate and effective remediation to students when needed.\"\nAmong other things, the organizations are specifically looking for tools that can further personalize math instruction via a focus on the \"whole student\"\u2014including children's mindsets, beliefs, attention, and \"affective\" or emotional states.\nMeasuring and improving students' executive function.\"Student success in academics and in future careers is associated with their ability to wrestle with multiple ideas at once, think flexibly, and regulate their action and thoughts,\" the Request for Information states. \"There is much to be done to track and improve students' progress on [executive function] development and connect it to real-world benefits, especially for those who are most at-risk.\"\nAreas of focus here include advances in techniques for tracking children's development of these skills and abilities, interventions (including \"technology-enhanced programs in or outside of school\") designed to improve desired behaviors, and supports for teachers.\nThe Gates Foundation is a traditional charitable foundation, chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Over the last decade-plus, the group has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars a year to such education-related causes as promoting small high schools, changing the way teachers are evaluated, and supporting development of the Common Core State Standards. Last October, the Gates Foundation announced a strategic shift in focus, including a new emphasis on \"locally-driven solutions\" and \"innovative research.\"\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, meanwhile, is a newer entity, founded and led by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan. Structured as a limited-liability corporation, CZI is free to make charitable donations, invest in for-profit companies, and engage in political lobbying and advocacy, with minimal disclosure requirements. The venture-philanthropy group has announced that it will give hundreds of millions of dollars annually to support a vision of \"whole-child personalized learning\" that aims to customize each child's educational experience based on their academic, social, emotional, and physical strengths, needs, and preferences.\nLast June, the two groups announced their first substantive collaboration: a $12 million joint award to an intermediary organization known as New Profit, which in turns supports organizations working to promote personalized learning.\nIn their new Request for Information, the Gates Foundation and CZI said that technology is not the focus of what they hope to spur, but it is expected to play a role.\nThe groups also emphasized that their new plan is currently in draft stage. Individuals, nonprofit groups, universities, private companies, and government-sponsored labs are invited to respond, with the expectation that those groups' input will in turn shape the foundations' funding plans moving forward.\nNo decision has yet been made as to how much money the groups will ultimately invest in the new R&D effort.\nWhy this new partnership, and why now?\n\"The reason our two philanthropies have decided to join hands in this effort is simple: We believe the scope and importance of this work exceeds what any single organization can or should undertake alone,\" wrote CZI president of education Jim Shelton and Gates Foundation director of K-12 education Bob Hughes in an op-ed published today by Fast Company.\n\"The purpose of the initiative is not to mandate anything.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Question by Jon: What is the best way to interact with or select job recruiters?\nI work primarily as a front end web developer and get calls from multiple recruitment firms. I do a fair bit of project work, so this is a recurring thing for me. Currently, if they have a position that I\u2019m a fit for I reflexively ask them to present me for that position. Is that an optimal strategy? If one company submits me, another cannot, so I want to be submitted by the best company. Should I therefore be taking steps to identify which recruiting firms are the most effective, give preference to local firms, find which firms ask the target employer for a smaller fee, select (somehow) for firms that have a better relationship with the target client, check out a firm\u2019s reputation online before submittal, etc. Or is all of that wasted work?\nI\u2019m looking for things that are efficient yet effective. Thanks for any tips!\nYes, I know I can work with several agencies for different jobs. However I CAN\u2019T work with several agencies for the SAME JOB. Not in California, in any case. Double submissions get thrown out, or else the second agency to submit is rejected."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "I heard many horror stories which often ended with, \u201cwell, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.\u201d Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.\nI had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!\nTwo weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn\u2019t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn\u2019t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.\nMy husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn\u2019t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn\u2019t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen next.\nWe finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn\u2019t even dilated. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn\u2019t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!\nThe diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! \u201cFake labor\u201d would not be in my cards, I had hoped.\nFortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn\u2019t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn\u2019t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.\n\u201cWhen your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again\u201d the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.\nA couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was \u201cif I need something, I\u2019ll let you know. Thanks.\u201d I literally couldn\u2019t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.\nAs my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.\nI had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!\nAs I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on \u2026 I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn\u2019t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn\u2019t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn\u2019t have to feel any pain with an epidural.\nThere were no walking epidurals available though and I didn\u2019t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn\u2019t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.\nAs the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning \u2013 a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn\u2019t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn\u2019t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body\u2019s cues.\nI started to go along with my body\u2019s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren\u2019t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say \u201cpush, his body is stuck!\u201d I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.\nThe midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life. He was so slippery, I was terrified to grab him. I had never held a baby before. He would be my first. I held my son and put him on my chest. I couldn\u2019t stop looking at him in awe. He was so beautiful to me and I felt overwhelmed with love and joy.\nWhen the umbilical cord finally stopped pulsating, which happened surprisingly quick, my husband carefully snipped it. At this point, I\u2019m glad my husband didn\u2019t pass out. I always joked that he would get queasy and faint, but my husband did amazing!\nWhile holding my son, I had to deliver my placenta which did not hurt at all. In fact, I couldn\u2019t even feel much down below because of the adrenaline pumping throughout my veins.\nLooking into my son\u2019s eyes and holding him for the first time was the most incredible thing in the world. The pain that I felt earlier in labor vanished and I felt ecstatic to have made it through. It\u2019s true what they say \u2026 After your baby is born, you forget the pain of labor and birth.\nAt least most of it.\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email."}
