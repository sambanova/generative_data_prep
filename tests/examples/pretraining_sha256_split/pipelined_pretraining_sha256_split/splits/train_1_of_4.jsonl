Lily Kaiser's journey is a little too convenient throughout the book but that can be just perfect sometimes. It can be exactly what I need to read or listen in order to balance out the pressure of the world.\nSo, yes, the book is a little too neat. The story a little too beautiful and coincidental and works a little too well, but I didn't mind it at all. Mostly because it was also written incredibly well. It moves between times, giving insight into Rose Gallway's life that Lily doesn't readily have and let's the reader piece some of it together on our own. I do enjoy that. And then the author lays it all out and it's just perfect. A little too perfect, like in one of those rom-coms that we watch to feel good but that we all know aren't the way the world works.\nI really loved that about it. It's going to be one of my comfort books, to peruse when I'm down, maybe listen to when I wanna revel in new beginnings, like the mood I re-watch Stardust in. If you've read a few too many mysteries lately, or too many books that ripped your heart out (like I have recently), than this is the perfect book to recover with.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "The entorhinal cortex receives a large projection from the piriform cortex, and synaptic plasticity in this pathway may affect olfactory processing. In vitro whole cell recordings have been used here to investigate postsynaptic signalling mechanisms that mediate the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in layer II entorhinal cortex cells. To induce LTD, pairs of pulses, using a 30-millisecond interval, were delivered at 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, consistent with a requirement for calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Induction of LTD was blocked when the FK506 was included in the intracellular solution to block the phosphatase calcineurin.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "I usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren\u2019t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you\u2019ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He\u2019s very well-trained.\nI think it\u2019s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry\u2019s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change\u2026I don\u2019t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.\nHenry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They\u2019re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he\u2019s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn\u2019t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry\u2019s growth has a greater impact on both of them.\nIt was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn\u2019t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He\u2019s very loving, but he\u2019s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin\u2019s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.\nI anticipate going a little deeper into Martin\u2019s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I\u2019ll present from Martin\u2019s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they\u2019re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I\u2019ve already covered from Henry\u2019s perspective to some extent, and when I\u2019m writing Henry, I\u2019m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.\nOffering Martin\u2019s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin\u2019s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I\u2019ve gotten the impression (whether it\u2019s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry\u2019s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin\u2019s perspective is a valuable addition."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Sony\u2019s first 3D TV is finally here, in the 40in shape of the KDL-40HX803. And to be honest, we\u2019re not expecting very much. For whenever we\u2019ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven\u2019t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let\u2019s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!\nRather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t wear Sony\u2019s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.\nIt doesn\u2019t do the 40HX803\u2018s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it\u2019s nothing like as slim as Samsung\u2019s edge LED icons. What\u2019s more, its edge LED system is a dynamic one, meaning that sections of the edge lighting can be independently controlled for a hopefully more impressive contrast performance than you usually get with a standard edge LED-lit LCD TV.\nSlightly surprisingly for such a slim screen, Sony has left most of its connections facing straight out of the TV\u2019s rear, rather than using the side access approach that would suit wall hanging. But at least the number and variety of these connections is pretty prodigious.\nFor instance, it has four HDMIs, all built to the v1.4 specification, so that they\u2019re compatible with 3D sources. Also of note are a USB input, an Ethernet port, and a 3D Sync terminal, which we\u2019ll look at in turn.\nThe USB can play music, video and photo files directly into the TV, but also allows you to add Wi-Fi to the 40HX803 via an optional USB dongle. It\u2019s a touch disappointing that the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t carry built-in Wi-Fi for its money, but it\u2019s hardly alone in preferring the optional upgrade route.\nThe Ethernet socket, meanwhile, has three uses. First, it supports the set\u2019s built-in Freeview HD tuner, to deliver potential future interactive services like the BBC iPlayer. Second, it provides a wired means of importing files stored on a DLNA PC. Finally, it allows you to take the TV online to experience Sony\u2019s Bravia Internet Video platform, which we\u2019ll return to in a minute.\nBut first we\u2019ve got to discuss the 3D Sync terminal. This is there because the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have a built-in 3D transmitter, unlike the Samsung and Panasonic 3D TVs we\u2019ve tested. In fact, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have 3D facilities at all in its standard form. You have to add an optional extra transmitter and optional pairs of active shutter glasses, with the transmitter costing \u00a350 and the glasses setting you back \u00a399 per pair. This effectively makes the 40HX803 \u00a31,887 if you want 3D with two pairs of glasses.\nWe do understand Sony\u2019s idea with this, to be fair. For it helps keep the 40HX803\u2019s up-front price down, allowing people to add 3D later as their finances allow. But there\u2019s no getting round the fact that once you\u2019ve 3Ded it up, the 40HX803 hits a similar price level to Samsung\u2019s 40C8000 integrated 3D TV. In other words, 3D continues to be very much a premium technology."}

However, a number of challenges and technical restraints persist, hindering its silvicultural expansion, among which are the lack of cloning technologies of superior genetic materials and their assessment under field conditions. Thus, we evaluated the potential use of araucaria plants derived from cuttings and seeds for timber production, by assessing field survival, growth and strobilus production using cuttings from male and female plants, collected from different positions, compared with those produced by sexual reproduction. Clones of male and female trees from different types of cuttings and seedlings were planted in 3 x 3 m spacing. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of one tree plot with three treatments. Female clones and apical cuttings showed higher growth in diameter at breast height (6.4 cm) and total height (3.6 m) 74 months after planting, followed by seedlings and other clones, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings technique is potential for araucaria propagation for wood production purposes, and it is favored by the use of apical cuttings from female mother trees."}

The venture-philanthropy group has announced that it will give hundreds of millions of dollars annually to support a vision of \"whole-child personalized learning\" that aims to customize each child's educational experience based on their academic, social, emotional, and physical strengths, needs, and preferences.\nLast June, the two groups announced their first substantive collaboration: a $12 million joint award to an intermediary organization known as New Profit, which in turns supports organizations working to promote personalized learning.\nIn their new Request for Information, the Gates Foundation and CZI said that technology is not the focus of what they hope to spur, but it is expected to play a role.\nThe groups also emphasized that their new plan is currently in draft stage. Individuals, nonprofit groups, universities, private companies, and government-sponsored labs are invited to respond, with the expectation that those groups' input will in turn shape the foundations' funding plans moving forward.\nNo decision has yet been made as to how much money the groups will ultimately invest in the new R&D effort.\nWhy this new partnership, and why now?\n\"The reason our two philanthropies have decided to join hands in this effort is simple: We believe the scope and importance of this work exceeds what any single organization can or should undertake alone,\" wrote CZI president of education Jim Shelton and Gates Foundation director of K-12 education Bob Hughes in an op-ed published today by Fast Company.\n\"The purpose of the initiative is not to mandate anything. It's to learn from the work that's currently happening in classrooms, universities, entrepreneurial efforts, and research centers throughout the country.\"\nNotice: We recently upgraded our comments.
