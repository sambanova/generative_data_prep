But it takes at least 20 years to evaluate how good a trends analyst was / is \u2013 so what about forecasts made by me in previous books, about what to expect over the following decade or two or three? How did those forecasts measure up? I had to answer that question for myself by re-reading what I wrote in the past about the future, before writing my latest book. Read FREE SAMPLE of The Truth about Almost Everything.\nSo you can judge for yourself, here are loads of predictions I made in the past - and the book in which they were made plus date. Every one of these is already a reality or looks like it soon could be, as of August 2015....And yes I got some things wrong - not many fortunately. I am going to publish the entire text of Futurewise 1998 edition on this website for a complete picture - but of course on this site already are hundreds of posts and videos going back in some cases over 20 years.\nHere's one I got wrong: I thought video streaming would take off - but with more use of live video using smartphones that we have actually seen. Most personal video streaming is of course things like YouTube clips.\nMost forecasting errors in my experience are not over WHAT is going to happen as the trend is usually fairly obvious, but by WHEN with questions about real impact.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Recently, I sat down to talk with a group of eight students from a large prominent church in Southern California. They were raised in the church. They were regulars at youth group. They claimed to be in relationship with Christ. Yet, they were dead. As I tried to engage them, most seemed unmoved and uninterested. And I was not surprised.\nAs I work with churches around the country, I encounter countless Christian students who are apathetic toward spiritual things. Their relationship with Christ is passionless. Talk of God is ho-hum. But why? Shouldn\u2019t our relationship with Christ be life\u2019s most exciting adventure? I\u2019m not suggesting the Christian life is one, big, emotional high, but why are students more willing to plug into their iPods than their Bibles? Why are they more excited about the latest celebrity gossip than the Gospel? Why aren\u2019t their lives filled with the drama of God\u2019s Kingdom?\nI think a big part of the problem is that Christian students rarely engage their world for the cause of Christ. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed in my training over the years. The most exciting events I do, the events where students seem to come to life, are those where there is some component of engagement. Let me illustrate.\nFor almost ten years now, I\u2019ve been taking students on mission trips to Berkeley and Utah. Each trip requires hours of training, typically in the form of classroom instruction and the reading of required books. This training is important and necessary, but it\u2019s not what generates the most buzz among the students. Students get fired up on the trip when we give them opportunities to engage non-believers.\nOn these trips we invite Mormon leaders, Unitarians, gay activists, Hare Krishna priests, skeptics, and atheists to dialogue with students. We give our non-Christian guests time to share their views, followed by a time of questions from our students. It\u2019s during Q&A when students really come to life. They ask question after question, graciously yet firmly force our skeptical guests to give a reason for their views. At the conclusion of each encounter, we thank our guests and then spend time debriefing. At this point, students are always abuzz, asking me question after question. Before I know it, an hour of discussing apologetics and theology with youth will have flown by.\nIn addition, we send our groups onto college campuses, like BYU or Berkeley, to conduct surveys. The surveys are designed to get our students into conversation with non-Christians students about spiritual issues. At first, students are fearful and anxious. They\u2019re skeptical about people\u2019s willingness to engage with them. But after an hour or two of surveys, students return and they are always pumped. During our debrief time, students can\u2019t wait to share about their encounters. They\u2019re filled with excitement about their conversations on campus with non-Christians.\nWhen we create opportunities for students to engage, there is a vibrancy that infuses the events. But this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Christianity is not a spectator sport. Our teaching should not remain in a classroom or behind the four walls of the church. If we want to train students who can defend the faith not just intelligently but passionately, we need to get them in the game. Think about any sports teams. It\u2019s the starters who are the most passionate about the game, right? The benchwarmers, not so much. I think that\u2019s one reason why our mission trips to Berkeley and Utah are exciting and successful. They get students in the game. They get students engaging a lost world with the truth of Jesus Christ.\nIn 2014, students will get a taste of being in the game as I take them to Berkeley and Utah. I\u2019ve already maxed out the number of mission trips I\u2019m capable of taking through July. Indeed, we\u2019ve had to turn groups away or ask them to start scheduling for 2015. So this year, we\u2019ll be getting students off the sidelines and igniting their fire for Christ. I can\u2019t wait."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "I usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren\u2019t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you\u2019ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He\u2019s very well-trained.\nI think it\u2019s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry\u2019s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change\u2026I don\u2019t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.\nHenry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They\u2019re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he\u2019s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn\u2019t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry\u2019s growth has a greater impact on both of them.\nIt was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn\u2019t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He\u2019s very loving, but he\u2019s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin\u2019s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.\nI anticipate going a little deeper into Martin\u2019s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I\u2019ll present from Martin\u2019s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they\u2019re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I\u2019ve already covered from Henry\u2019s perspective to some extent, and when I\u2019m writing Henry, I\u2019m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.\nOffering Martin\u2019s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin\u2019s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I\u2019ve gotten the impression (whether it\u2019s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry\u2019s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin\u2019s perspective is a valuable addition."}

After a promising debut with \"The Living End\" followed by the angrier, more marginalized \"Totally F***ed Up,\" Mr. Araki is still sounding a note of self-congratulatory teen-age rebellion in a film gruesome and obvious enough to make \"Natural Born Killers\" look like a model of restraint.\nIt's not even much of a change to find \"The Doom Generation\" billed as \"a heterosexual movie,\" since it shares the effective homoerotic energy of his earlier work. That this film includes a teen-age girl, Amy Blue (Rose McGowan), as part of its sexual menage only means one especially clear target of contempt (\"Don't get your uterus all tied in a knot\" is one of the more printable things anyone says to her) in a film overflowing with it. Amy's insolence and Anna Karina hairdo (like Uma Thurman's in \"Pulp Fiction\") may offer a touch of Godard. But this film's satire of teen-age-wasteland cinema is so coarsely exaggerated that any homage is beside the point.\nVoluptuous Xavier Red (Johnathon Schaech) is way ahead of charmingly dim Jordan White (James Duval) in getting the hint about this, but it doesn't matter: \"The Doom Generation\" leads them both to a gory demonstration of America's intolerance toward sexual nonconformists. Obscured by strobe lights and boosted by the alternative-rock soundtrack that's sure to help sell the movie, this already notorious castration sequence is one of several gross-out epiphanies here. Others include the severing of a head that still talks, and even vomits, after it is removed from a vein-spurting body, and a blink-of-the-eye cameo by Heidi Fleiss.\nThe genuine enthusiasm Mr. Araki brings to this film's bedroom scenes, with their whimsical sets and jokey porn ambiance, is matched by the occasionally workable black humor in his screenplay. (\"You murdered two people tonight. Doesn't that faze you at all?\" \"Yeah, I'm bummed. To the max.\") But sledgehammer direction, heavy irony and the easiest imaginable targets hardly show talent off to good advantage.\nWritten, edited and directed by Gregg Araki; director of photography, Jim Fealy; music by the Jesus and Mary Chain, Nine Inch Nails, Showdive, Curve, Meat Beat Manifesto, Pizzicato Five, Cocteau Twins and others; production designer, Therese Deprez; produced by Andrea Sperling, Mr. Araki and Why Not Productions (France); released by Trimark Pictures.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O Kuntze (Paran\u00e1 pine or Araucaria) is a potential forestry native species for Brazilian silviculture. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints persist, hindering its silvicultural expansion, among which are the lack of cloning technologies of superior genetic materials and their assessment under field conditions. Thus, we evaluated the potential use of araucaria plants derived from cuttings and seeds for timber production, by assessing field survival, growth and strobilus production using cuttings from male and female plants, collected from different positions, compared with those produced by sexual reproduction. Clones of male and female trees from different types of cuttings and seedlings were planted in 3 x 3 m spacing. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of one tree plot with three treatments. Female clones and apical cuttings showed higher growth in diameter at breast height (6.4 cm) and total height (3.6 m) 74 months after planting, followed by seedlings and other clones, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings technique is potential for araucaria propagation for wood production purposes, and it is favored by the use of apical cuttings from female mother trees."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "I heard many horror stories which often ended with, \u201cwell, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.\u201d Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.\nI had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!\nTwo weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn\u2019t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn\u2019t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.\nMy husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn\u2019t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn\u2019t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen next.\nWe finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn\u2019t even dilated. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn\u2019t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!\nThe diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! \u201cFake labor\u201d would not be in my cards, I had hoped.\nFortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn\u2019t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn\u2019t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.\n\u201cWhen your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again\u201d the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.\nA couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was \u201cif I need something, I\u2019ll let you know. Thanks.\u201d I literally couldn\u2019t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.\nAs my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.\nI had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!\nAs I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on \u2026 I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn\u2019t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn\u2019t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn\u2019t have to feel any pain with an epidural.\nThere were no walking epidurals available though and I didn\u2019t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn\u2019t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.\nAs the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning \u2013 a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn\u2019t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn\u2019t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body\u2019s cues.\nI started to go along with my body\u2019s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren\u2019t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say \u201cpush, his body is stuck!\u201d I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.\nThe midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life. He was so slippery, I was terrified to grab him. I had never held a baby before. He would be my first. I held my son and put him on my chest. I couldn\u2019t stop looking at him in awe. He was so beautiful to me and I felt overwhelmed with love and joy.\nWhen the umbilical cord finally stopped pulsating, which happened surprisingly quick, my husband carefully snipped it. At this point, I\u2019m glad my husband didn\u2019t pass out. I always joked that he would get queasy and faint, but my husband did amazing!\nWhile holding my son, I had to deliver my placenta which did not hurt at all. In fact, I couldn\u2019t even feel much down below because of the adrenaline pumping throughout my veins.\nLooking into my son\u2019s eyes and holding him for the first time was the most incredible thing in the world. The pain that I felt earlier in labor vanished and I felt ecstatic to have made it through. It\u2019s true what they say \u2026 After your baby is born, you forget the pain of labor and birth.\nAt least most of it.\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "see how it would perform under real-world flexing, saving prototypes.\nTwo recent examples, one in the U.S. and one in the U.K., show the improvements and time/cost savings engineers have realized from their use of engineering software.\nIn Camberly, U.K., the design team at reseller Williams Medical Supplies set up a new technical development department to design medical products and settled on Solid Edge (UGS) as its core design tool. \u201cOur aim is to take a routine surgical instrument and bring something new to the design that will provide significant benefit,\u201d says Robert Steele, technical development director. Among their projects: the Opmaster Series 4 surgery operating table. The enhanced design allows a patient to be examined, operated on, and recover on the same table.\nThe result was a major time savings, largely the result of not doing many prototypes. \u201cIn fact, we were almost able to dispense with the prototyping phase and go straight to manufacturing,\u201d Steele asserts.\nWorking with different software and on a vastly different product line, engineers at San Diego-based Tensys Medical, Inc. had similar results.\nUsing SolidWorks for CAD and COSMOSWorks for FEA (both from Dassault Systemes, Inc.) the engineering team developed the T-Line[R] Tensymeter, a non-invasive arterial blood-pressure management system for use in surgery. Their goal was to replace the traditional cuff-based monitors that provide only intermittent measurements every few minutes. That kind of irregular monitoring can delay recognition of rapid changes in blood pressure.\nThe design concept uses an actuator to move a sensor over the patient\u2019s wrist to find the best position for producing a continuous waveform. \u201cThe sensor has to float within a rigid frame attached to a serpentine arm that\u2019s designed to flex. The team used COSMOSWORKS to identify areas of high stress for the olefin-based serpentine arm and used the analysis results to make design modifications.\nAmong those modifications, says Senior Engineer Russ Hempstead: \u201cWe removed the stress risers, added radii, and added thickening sections.\u201d He and the engineering team didn\u2019t expect to see the stress risers, but when they did they put static flexing on part of the serpentine arm so they could move it the way it would move in the real world. The software enabled the team to shorten the design cycle by 60 percent. They cut manufacturing time by four percent, material costs by three percent, and labor costs by three-four percent. In all, engineers did seven or eight analysis studies in just a couple of days.\nIndustrial workplaces are governed by OSHA rules, but this isn\u2019t to say that rules are always followed. While injuries happen on production floors for a variety of reasons, of the top 10 OSHA rules that are most often ignored in industrial settings, two directly involve machine design: lockout/tagout procedures (LO/TO) and machine guarding.\nFocus on Fundamentals consists of 45-minute on-line classes that cover a host of technologies.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Ever since Frank Gehry\u2019s spectacular Guggenheim Bilbao put its sleepy namesake city on the radar of architecture buffs two decades ago, design has became an integral aspect of travel and tourism, joining food, culture and climate when it comes to visitor draws. This year, the list of destinations sure to entice design fans includes spots from the West Indies to North Africa. They offer a wide range of aesthetic attractions, from cutting-edge urban design to exquisite historical gems.\nWhether the recent detente between the United States and Cuba will result in an onslaught of American visitors to the island or not, Canadians aren\u2019t waiting to find out: According to KAYAK, a world-leading travel search engine, Havana is one of the year\u2019s top 10 trending destinations among travellers from the Great White North, whose online inquiries about the city skyrocketed by 230 percent compared to last year. In anticipation of more visitors, hotels in Havana are being modernized and restaurants given new polish, but it\u2019s the bustling metropolis\u2019 status as a living design museum that no doubt appeals to most foreigners. For architecture fans, hotels like the Nacional offer glimpses into long-gone eras, while automobile buffs would be hard-pressed to find a greater parade of vintage cars. Speaking of moveable feasts, bars like La Floridita, where Ernest Hemingway indulged his fondness for daiquiris, are modern-day links to literary and artistic legends. Clearly, the time to visit Havana is now, whatever your aesthetic bent.\nOver the past several years, restaurant-rich Grand Cayman, the largest of the Cayman Islands, has been nurturing a reputation as the culinary capital of the Caribbean. Now, its growing foodie cred is being matched by its design cachet. In November, the ultra-sleek Kimpton Seafire Resort + Spa, designed by U.S. firm SB Architects, opened on Seven Mile Beach, bringing a welcome shot of global chic (plus four more dining options) to that pristine stretch of coastline. Not far away, Camana Bay, an ambitious mixed-use development, has been heralded as a rare example of new urbanism in the region, its 500 acres encompassing high-end shops, office and residential space, interactive fountains and a pedestrianized main street called the Paseo. Situated between the Kimpton and Camana Bay is the Caribbean Club, a luxury apartment hotel and ideal base for exploring the area; it also houses one of Grand Cayman\u2019s foremost eateries, the trattoria Luca.\nAnother top trender among Canadian travellers according to KAYAK is Casablanca, the romantic Moroccan city that has long offered a beguiling mix of French and Arabic cultures. Nowhere is this hybrid allure more visible than in its architecture, which ranges from the art deco elegance of Place Mohammed V to contemporary showstoppers like the Four Seasons Casablanca on the oceanfront Corniche. At bustling Marche Centrale, the Moorish-style setting is as enticing as the fried fish and grilled vegetables, while L\u2019Atelier 21, the city\u2019s leading modern art gallery, showcases emerging and established artists in an au courant space. New air links to Casablanca from Canada this year make visiting even easier.\nThe British capital has always been a magnet for design aficionados, but 2017 offers an extra-special reason to visit: the recently transplanted Design Museum, which has been moved from its previous home on the south bank of the Thames to much larger digs in Kensington. Ten years in the making, the $140-million wood-and-concrete marvel, reimagined by minimalist architect John Pawson on the site of the former Commonwealth Institute, is the Brit superstar\u2019s first public building in London. Visitors must pay to see special exhibitions, but the museum\u2019s extensive permanent collection, which includes everything from a 2012 Olympic torch to a full-size Tube car, is free to view. Another area museum completing a major update this year is the venerable Victoria and Albert, which will unveil a new underground gallery and a new entrance on Exhibition Road in July. Even the city\u2019s best watering holes are offering new eye candy: Check out the restored blue walls in The Berkeley\u2019s expanded Blue Bar."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\nI am the developer of jOOQ, a Java database abstraction framework. I was wondering whether jOOQ might be an interesting tool for discussion on your website, even if it is not exactly an ORM in the classic meaning (as in mapping objects to the relational world > ORM). Instead, jOOQ uses a reverse engineering paradigm (as in mapping relational entities to objects > \"ROM\").\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\nObject Role Modeling (the original ORM) is not the same thing as Object/Relational Mapping.\nYour query DSL looks rather like some of the DSLs available for Ruby, such as through the Sequel gem, or Arel. Interesting to see how well that can work with a statically-types language like Java. Maybe you or I should make a generator for ActiveFacts which generates your DSL from CQL queries?\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\nSorry for my late reply. Apparently I had not really understood the ideas behind your foundation when I wrote my original post. I understand now, that you are concerned with broader concepts than the \"common ORM\". I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping, correct me if I'm wrong).\nYes, I have seen some examples for Ruby's Sequel. I personally find statically-typed languages much better for DSL's as the syntax can be formally defined and checked by a compiler - with the limitations an OO language imposes, of course.\nSo if I understand this correctly now, \"Object Role Modeling\" and CQL are actually a more general way of expressing what SQL calls DDL. Since you can already transform CQL into SQL DDL statements (CREATE TABLE...), and jOOQ can reverse-engineer database schemata into jOOQ generated source code, I don't think there would be need for an additional generator.\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\nObject Role Modeling was named before Object Relational Mapping, but the latter is now the more common meaning, as you point out. But ORM Lite is actually so-named by Bryan because it is an implementation of Object Role Modeling, not because it is also an O/RM. Bryan was a student of Terry's at Neumont, where he learnt ORM.\nRegarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.\nThis may be hard to see for someone used to O-O modeling, and who's authored an O/RM tool. The problem is that O-O suffers from many of the same problems of loss of semantics. The apparently clear notion of \"attribute\" breaks down when you look at it closely. O-O, although ostensibly behaviour-oriented, introduces attributes to store state, and this attribute orientation is the source of the problem in both cases. Fact-oriented model does not use attributes. Although it may seem obvious that, for example, my surname is an attribute of myself, if the system being modeled accrues the requirement to model families, suddenly surname becomes an attribute of family, and family becomes my attribute. This kind of instability is responsible for much of the rework that's required in evolving legacy systems, as well as many of the mistakes made when they were first modeled. If you want a further example of this loss of semantics, look at my Insurance example, and ask yourself why the VehicleIncident table has a DrivingBloodTestResult column. In fact, if VehicleIncident wasn't explicitly mapped separately, its fields would be in the Claim table.\nWhat's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model. Surprisingly, I can't think of a single tool which has done a good job of this, but it's where I'm heading with the ActiveFacts API. It's another O/RM, but using a purely conceptual object model that preserves the domain semantics, not a typical O-O one.\nYes, though the published implementation doesn't quite handle the full query syntax (aggregate functions are still missing), nor does it yet translate them to SQL. Some examples are given towards the end of the video presentation on the CQL Introduction page.\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\nRegarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.\nAbsolutely. The optimal way to implement SQL in Java would be by extending the Java language itself, such that SQL would be compiled natively by the java compiler, similar to Linq2SQL in C#, or PL/SQL in Oracle databases. So for the complexity of CQL, CQL is certainly the right solution.\nThe problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models.\nIn any case, I don't see jOOQ as a means to solve modelling issues, or the O/R impedance mismatch (which is even bigger when it comes to mapping your understanding of ORM, with CQL). jOOQ should simply make using the full power of SQL in Java as simple as possible. In that way, jOOQ is not really an ORM because it does not map from objects to the relational world, or try to solve any other high-level abstraction issues. It's really a low-level tool to make a developer's life a lot easier, seeing that unfortunately, JPA CriteriaQuery didn't meet the community's expectations.\nWhat's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model. Surprisingly, I can't think of a single tool which has done a good job of this, but it's where I'm heading with the ActiveFacts API. It's another O/RM, but using a purely conceptual object model that preserves the domain semantics, not a typical O-O one.\nI think you're on the right track with this. I hope for you, that this will soon show nice results with a practical implementation. I'm curious to see how you'll tackle performance issues, too, with all the abstraction. Among all attempts to overcome the old and proven relational models (XML databases, NoSQL databases), this one seems the most promising and focused to me!"}
