It is the world's first \"out of the box\" triple fan cooler and is compatible with Intel latest LGA2011 Sandy Bridge E processors.\nWorlds first \"out of the box\" triple fan CPU coolerThere are many CPU coolers available on the market that can accommodate three fans, but to make this happen at least one additional fan needs to be purchased which add to the expense. With the Zalman CNPS12X you get three 120mm blue LED fans built into the cooler so there is no extra costs. Also all three fans run off one fan header, making powering the fans extremely easy.\nSix W-DTH composite heatpipes for excellent heat transferFirst seen on the CNPS11X, composite heatpipes help transfer the heat from the CPU up to 50% faster than standard heatpipes. This helps to increase the performance of the cooler even further. The six heatpipes are U-shaped, which effectively double the heat transfer compared to none U-shaped heatpipes.At the base of the cooler (where the heatpipes make contact with the CPU) the heatpipes utilise what Zalman call Whole-Direct Touch Heatpipes (W-DTH). This allows the heatpipes to make direct contact with the CPU, another feature to help increase performance. But not only that, the area of the Direct Touch will cover the whole CPU. Even the new Intel CPUs for LGA2011 will also be covered by W-DTH.\n100% nickel plated with blue LED fans for amazing aestheticsMost CPU coolers are hidden inside the computer case where they go about their business unseen. But if you like to show off the internals of the PC you may want a CPU cooler than looks the part, and boy the CNPS12X does look the part!The entire heatsink of CNPS12X is plated with \"Black-Pearl\" nickel for a long-term corrosion resistance, while the deep \"Black-Pearl\" tone, along with the high intensity from the blue LED fans helps this cooler stand head and shoulders above the rest."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "I heard many horror stories which often ended with, \u201cwell, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.\u201d Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.\nI had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!\nTwo weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn\u2019t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn\u2019t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.\nMy husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn\u2019t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn\u2019t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen next.\nWe finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn\u2019t even dilated. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn\u2019t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!\nThe diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! \u201cFake labor\u201d would not be in my cards, I had hoped.\nFortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn\u2019t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn\u2019t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.\n\u201cWhen your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again\u201d the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.\nA couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was \u201cif I need something, I\u2019ll let you know. Thanks.\u201d I literally couldn\u2019t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.\nAs my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.\nI had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!\nAs I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on \u2026 I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn\u2019t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn\u2019t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn\u2019t have to feel any pain with an epidural.\nThere were no walking epidurals available though and I didn\u2019t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn\u2019t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.\nAs the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning \u2013 a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn\u2019t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn\u2019t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body\u2019s cues.\nI started to go along with my body\u2019s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren\u2019t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say \u201cpush, his body is stuck!\u201d I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.\nThe midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life. He was so slippery, I was terrified to grab him. I had never held a baby before. He would be my first. I held my son and put him on my chest. I couldn\u2019t stop looking at him in awe. He was so beautiful to me and I felt overwhelmed with love and joy.\nWhen the umbilical cord finally stopped pulsating, which happened surprisingly quick, my husband carefully snipped it. At this point, I\u2019m glad my husband didn\u2019t pass out. I always joked that he would get queasy and faint, but my husband did amazing!\nWhile holding my son, I had to deliver my placenta which did not hurt at all. In fact, I couldn\u2019t even feel much down below because of the adrenaline pumping throughout my veins.\nLooking into my son\u2019s eyes and holding him for the first time was the most incredible thing in the world. The pain that I felt earlier in labor vanished and I felt ecstatic to have made it through. It\u2019s true what they say \u2026 After your baby is born, you forget the pain of labor and birth.\nAt least most of it.\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email."}
