{"prompt": "", "completion": "The Japan America Society celebrates the full autumn moon each year with an outdoor picnic, Japanese music, and haiku poetry. Although not commonly observed in modern-day Japan, the moon viewing tradition dates back to the Heian Period (794\u2013A.D. 1185), when the evening was marked with poetry and music by court aristocrats. The celebration later spread to warriors, townspeople, and farmers, and became a harvest festival.\nBring a picnic supper, beverage, and something to sit on as no food or drink will be sold at the event or pre-order an Obento from Mr. Sushi for $18 when purchasing your celebration tickets. Alcohol is not allowed at Winfrey Point, a City of Dallas park facility. For more information, visit jasdfw.org."}

Coats matching the mane 6 and some extra ponies with the inside color the hair and the outside the ponies' coat color, with their cutie mark in the bottom left or right side on the back. With Rainbow Dash's, the elastic fabric that's on the end of the sleeves and on the waist of the coat can be rainbow colored, with the inside color matching her eyes. Oh and the zipper handle being something they enjoy, for example, Pinkie Pie's would be a cupcake, Twilight's a book, and Applejack's an apple. Sound good?"}
