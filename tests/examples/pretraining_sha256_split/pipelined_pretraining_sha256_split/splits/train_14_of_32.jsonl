{"prompt": "", "completion": "I listened to this one, narrated by Justine Eyre. It was about 12 hours long, but it passed by quickly with this fun read. It's not particularly deep or magical and it doesn't call life as we know it into question.\nIt's a nice read/listen, light and intriguing for anyone in the mood for a little escape from the disappointments that have been abounding.\nFunny enough, the only problems with the book are also reasons why I liked it. Lily Kaiser's journey is a little too convenient throughout the book but that can be just perfect sometimes. It can be exactly what I need to read or listen in order to balance out the pressure of the world.\nSo, yes, the book is a little too neat. The story a little too beautiful and coincidental and works a little too well, but I didn't mind it at all. Mostly because it was also written incredibly well. It moves between times, giving insight into Rose Gallway's life that Lily doesn't readily have and let's the reader piece some of it together on our own. I do enjoy that. And then the author lays it all out and it's just perfect. A little too perfect, like in one of those rom-coms that we watch to feel good but that we all know aren't the way the world works.\nI really loved that about it. It's going to be one of my comfort books, to peruse when I'm down, maybe listen to when I wanna revel in new beginnings, like the mood I re-watch Stardust in. If you've read a few too many mysteries lately, or too many books that ripped your heart out (like I have recently), than this is the perfect book to recover with. It's comforting and sweet and romantic and doesn't take itself too seriously. But it's not the book for that serious deep read. Don't expect it to be."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "I admit I never thought I\u2019d do any analytical work on Resident Evil 4. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it\u2019s one of my favorite games. Being extremely fun to play, and a having a wonderfully creepy aesthetic are just a few of the game\u2019s strengths. But it\u2019s a silly game in a lot of ways. There aren\u2019t larger messages and meanings to glean from it. And at some moments, the game mechanics and the overall story don\u2019t match up very well. I\u2019d like to discuss one of those moments: Luis\u2019s famous death in castle. I\u2019ll use this example to discuss the elements of motivation and capacity in video games.\nYou may recall from my previous article a discussion of a player\u2019s motivation and capacity while playing a video game. Although I mentioned these terms, I never adequately defined them, so I\u2019ll do so now. A player\u2019s motivation is the reason he or she cares about playing the game and effecting some kind of difference in the world and story in which he or she is immersed. This element is present in other mediums\u2014it\u2019s the reason we continue to read/watch the story. A player\u2019s capacity, unlike motivation, is intrinsically tied to game mechanics; it consists of the things that the player is able to do in the game world. The analogue of capacity in other media is simply the reader\u2019s ability to continue to watch or read the story. There are further complexities in games, however, including that a player\u2019s degree of capacity can effect his or her motivation, but that is a discussion for another time (probably focusing on Deus Ex). For now, recall my claim that in order for a game to be truly impactful, both of these elements must exist (or noticeably not exist, as I\u2019ll discuss in my next article). Note also that the capacity element is harder and more important to make present, since it\u2019s the element that video games have introduced to storytelling.\nSo let\u2019s see whether both motivation and capacity exist in the case of Luis\u2019s death. For those who haven\u2019t played the game, you can watch a video of the moment below.\nI\u2019ll summarize the scene: Luis was attempting to help you get a \u201csample\u201d of great value from the game\u2019s primary villain, Saddler. But Saddler kills Luis, taking back the sample (classic). As Luis lies dying before you, he gives you a temporary antidote to the parasite that you are infected with, and tells you to stop Saddler. When he finally passes away, Leon yells out him name in anguish.\nSo this moment most certainly provides the player with motivation. And there are multiple reasons for this. In his final moments, Luis literally gives the player the primary plot incentive for the remainder of the game: stop Saddler and get the sample back. On top of that, finding out that Leon isn\u2019t doomed to die at the hands of his parasite energies the player with a new sense of hope. But, most importantly, the player\u2019s motivation is an extension of Leon\u2019s grief. If the player empathizes with Leon (hopefully they do if they\u2019ve gotten this far in the game), when Leon cries out in agony over the death of his friend, the player, too, is motivated seek justice for a lost friend. This is the opposite of Link\u2019s silence that I discussed in my last article. Unlike Link, who leaves you to form your experience for yourself, Leon hands you his grief, and in this way motivates you to action. This is good storytelling. Clearly Resident Evil 4 has nailed the motivational aspect of making a powerful narrative in a game. But at this point there\u2019s no particular reason story-wise to play the game instead of just watching it.\nSo let\u2019s think about capacity. Capacity is the additional element that makes a video game unique as opposed to movies or books. And the extent of what video games can do with capacity hasn\u2019t been fully explored. So, even though it\u2019s not necessary for a game to use dynamics of capacity in order to tell a good story, ignoring this element is missing an opportunity for better storytelling. Since capacity is unique to games, if there\u2019s no interesting storytelling or fun mechanics, there\u2019s no reason to play the game instead of just watch it.\nNow, in order to discuss capacity in the case of death, capacity takes on a slight nuance. When a character dies in a game, the key aspect of capacity is actually the change in capacity. It doesn\u2019t matter so much what the capacity level is in general, it just matters if there is a difference before and after a character\u2019s death. This provides meaning for the death within the structure of the game mechanics. For example, if a character dies in a game but is immediately replaced by an almost identical analogue, their death has little visceral impact for the player, who can\u2019t feel the impact of the character\u2019s death on the gameplay. This actually does happen: in Legend of The Dragoon, when one of your party members, Lavitz, dies, Albert, who literally takes on the stats of Lavitz, almost immediately replaces him. Even more notably, Cait Sith dies in Final Fantasy VII, but is quite literally replaced by an entirely identical avatar called \u201cCait Sith 2\u201d. In these situations the player\u2019s capacity has not changed, and thus the deaths have lost some of their potential narrative impact.\nThat\u2019s kind of what it feels like when Luis dies in Resident Evil 4. Although he helps you out as a non-player character (NPC) at various points in the game, it\u2019s not as though he\u2019s the only character who does this. And there\u2019s nothing to distinguish him mechanics-wise from the other characters you meet and team up with. What\u2019s more, you continue to have access to other NPCs you can get help from after he dies. So, in terms of how it feels to play the game, you don\u2019t even notice he\u2019s gone. As far as the player\u2019s capacity to team up with others in order to stay alive, very little changes after Luis\u2019s death. The player\u2019s capacity thus changes very little when he dies, and though the player grieves with Leon, it\u2019s difficult to feel a real sense of loss.\nTo sum up, although the story of Luis\u2019s death in Resident Evil is well told in terms of movies and books, the developers missed the opportunity to tell this story through the game mechanics in terms of a change in player capacity. Luis was not a unique character mechanically, and other characters that Leon meets effectively replace his avatar. The death is meaningful to watch, but far less meaningful to play.\nNathan Randall is a Master\u2019s candidate in game design at FIEA.
