{"prompt": "", "completion": "After last weeks episode, I was really curious what they had in store for us this week. How the heroes will come back to Earth after such a traumatic experience. And good thing for us, this episode is rightly named \u201cThe Aftermath of Hero Killer: Stain\u201d.\nWe open with Izuku, Iida, and Todoroki all in the hospital. They are all recovering from their tremendous fight. But also reflecting how lucky they are to be alive still. The door opens and we see Gran Torino and Pro Hero Manual. First thing Gran Torino does of course is scold Midoriya. But before Gran Torino goes full instructor on him, he tells the boys that they have a visitor.\nA tall figure turns the corner wearing a professional business suit. It\u2019s Hosu\u2019s chief of police, Kenji Tsuragamae. Who also happens to look like a dog (just go along with it I guess?). Kenji tells the boys that Stain is in custody and is being treated for several broken bones and serious burns. He also reminds them that what they have done was not okay on paper. Uncertified heroes using their Quirks against their instructors orders is highly frowned upon. But Todoroki is not taking it. He tells the chief that if Iida didn\u2019t step in, then Pro Hero Native would have been killed. And the both of them would have been killed without Izuku\u2019s help. But Gran Torino tells Todoroki to hear the chief out.\nKenji tells them that the punishment would only happen if this was made public. And the people would applaud their efforts anyway. But if the police kept it quiet, no one gets punished, but the boys don\u2019t get the praise they deserve. Instead Endeavor will get the praise from the masses. It would also explain Stain\u2019s burn scars. So they choose to not be celebrated as heroes and apologize anyways. But Kenji tells them he respects what they did and he thanks them for protecting the peace.\nSo it has hit the news that Endeavor has stopped hero killer Stain and the nomus from destroying Hosu City. It\u2019s all anyone is talking about. Meanwhile, we get a look at how everyone else from Class 1-A is doing in their internship programs. First we look at Bakugo who is having a less than stellar time. The first thing he wants to do is go knock some heads around but his mentor is not allowing him and says it will be business as usual. Hopefully that could help Bakugo control his temper. Kirishima finds out the reason why Midoriya sent him his location. Apparently he also reported the incident last night. Go Kirishima! Momo debuted in a commercial with her mentor and it seems obvious modelling is not what she wants to be doing. But her mentor is letting her go on patrol like she has wanted since the start of their training together.\nAnd finally there is Uraraka who is on the phone with Midoriya. She tells him how glad she is that they are all safe. Midoriya of course apologizes for not contacting sooner but she understands. In the midst of the conversation, Uraraka\u2019s mentor Gunhead reminds her that they are going to start their basic training. She then says bye to Midoriya and Gunhead asks in a very cute way, \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d. And she immediately dismisses it. When Midoriya hangs up he gets all worked up that he talked to a girl on the phone. This scene was my favorite from this episode it had me busting up!\nWe get back to the guys in the hospital and Iida comes out and tells the two that he may have long-term damage in his hand. But he reflects on his actions from that night and regrets them greatly. He shouldn\u2019t have acted so swiftly and carelessly. But Midoriya doesn\u2019t let Iida beat himself up too much. He agrees that him and Iida should get stronger together.\nWe cut to U.A. with All Might in the staff room. He gets a phone call from Gran Torino. He tells All Might that he has had his teaching licence revoked for six months because of Midoriya\u2019s actions but there was no way of avoiding that and that he has come to terms with it. But All Might is very ashamed of himself for letting down his former instructor. But this isn\u2019t the reason Gran Torino called. He really wants to talk about Stain. He says in the few minutes he was with him, it had him trembling. It was because of how intimidating and obsessed he was on what he think a hero should be and what he will do to correct our society. Because this has hit so many news stations, Stains ideology and opinions will be put on blast. People will become influenced by Stain\u2019s beliefs and become a plague. But All Might doesn\u2019t believe it will be a problem because they will probably show up sporadically and they will be taken out 1 by 1. But this is where the League of Villains comes in. If they all combine their hatred and Shigaraki gives them an outlet to express and deal with their evil intentions, it will become a serious problem. Gran Torino then reminds All Might that he must tell Midoriya properly what is concerning him and One for All. Which I have no idea what that is all about. Apparently the quirk is \u201con the move\u201d? I\u2019m interested in what that might mean.\nThis episode was mostly a lot of dialogue and context but it was needed after such a shift in the story. It was refreshing getting some insight on how everyone else is doing too. I\u2019m hoping next time they elaborate on what is concerning All Might and what is happening with his quirk? Only time will tell."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "It is done, and submitted. You can play \u201cSurvival of the Tastiest\u201d on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\nThere\u2019s a lot I\u2019d like to talk about. I\u2019ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise \u2013 something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like \u201cEvolution\u201d in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it\u2019s not evolution anymore \u2013 it\u2019s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that\u2019s not something that rubbed me the right way.\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn\u2019t want to create an \u201cintelligent design\u201d simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I\u2019d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven\u2019t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn\u2019t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the \u201cMechanical Underdogs\u201d signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist \u2013 by evolving from a normal dinner table.\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your \u201cbase\u201d. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by \u201cordering\u201d them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield\u2019s standard \u201cConquest\u201d mode).\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted \u2013 it\u2019ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working \u2013 I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It\u2019s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I\u2019d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who\u2019s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate\u2019s bill.\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it\u2019s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\nPlus, if you\u2019re zoomed out too much, you can\u2019t actually read it, so it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\nOne other solution that didn\u2019t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that\u2019s indicated by the plate\u2019s decoration \u2013 its color denotes the team owner. But it\u2019s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious \u201cCall Waiter\u201d button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team\u2019s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn\u2019t get it all done.\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta \u2013 barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn\u2019t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you\u2019d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it\u2019s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn\u2019t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That\u2019s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well \u2013 the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It\u2019s very hard for people to understand what\u2019s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\nI\u2019m extremely happy with what I\u2019ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot of what not to do.\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping \u2013 deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\nI\u2019m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you\u2019ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "In her firstbook Stay Hungry Stay Foolish Rashmi Bansal profiled twenty five entrepreneurs who were alumni of IIM \u2013 Ahmedabad. Many had then wondered including yours truly, how important an MBA degree is to become an entrepreneur. Rashmi claims this inspired her to write Connect The Dots, story of twenty one entrepreneurs but who dont have an MBA degree. The format of the book is same as her last book. There are twenty chapters, one on each entrepreneur (Gaurav Rathore & Saurabh Vyas who co founded PoliticalEDGE are covered in one chapter) and the entire chapter is based on one single interview.\nThe book is divided in three sections : Jugaad, Junoon & Zubaan. Jugaadis are those who didn\u2019t get any formal training in business but learned by observing, experimenting and applying their mind. It includes some one like Kunwer Sachdev of Su-Kam who created a Rs 500 crore company from scratch; Ganesh Ram, who started what is today India\u2019s largest English training academy, VETA when there were no BPOs and no one knew that English coaching would be as big a market as it is now.\nJunoonis as the name suggests, are passionate about something that is ahead of its time. This was my favorite section in the book. Gaurav Rathore and Saurabh Vyas envisioned a consulting and research firm exclusively for politics and founded PoliticalEDGE; Satyajit Singh, founder of Shakti Sudha not only created a new industry but also benefited thousands of farmers in rural Bihar; Chetan Maini, founder of Reva, designed a solar car and has been producing electric cars since the time when global warming was not so well known and creating electric cars seemed to make little sense.\nThe third section Zubaan is about creative people like Paresh Mokashi, creator of Harishchandrachi Factory, India\u2019s official entry to Oscar last year or Krishna Reddy, whose Prince Dance Group, consisting of daily wage laborers won India\u2019s Got Talent last year.\nI had great hopes from the book as I loved Stay Hungry Stay Foolish. The first chapter on Prem Ganpathy is literally a rags to riches story of someone who came to Mumbai with no money and now owns Dosa Plaza, a fast food chain with 26 outlets in the country.The rest of the stories too are very encouraging. The book is replete with inspiring anecdotes and quotes . When I read the synopsis on the third section i.e. Zubaan, I thought it would be probably the weak link in this book as stories on creatives who had made it big in the field of art would be a misfit in this book about entrepreneurs. However, all these artists achieved commercial success by following their passion and this justifies their inclusion in this book about Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship after all is about following your heart.\nGenerally when the first book is good and successful authors fail to recreate the magic in their subsequent books and that too in the same genre, as people have high expectations. In this case Rashmi Bansal definitely exceeded my expectations. A very good book and must read for some one aspires to be an entrepreneur."}
