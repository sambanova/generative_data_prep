Susy even put up a Facebook page where all info, photos and videos in relation to the search was posted.\nFinally after weeks of anticipation, Susy and Geno reunited again where the two met up not only with each other but with their loyal and very enthusiastic supporters, waving banners and placards expressing their unwavering support.\nGeno arrived at the activity center holding a fresh bouquet for Susy. It was a wonderful day for Susy and Geno and for their solid fans club. After long years of waiting, the two best friends shared a long and warm embrace.\nCheck out this YouTube video dance performance from Susy and Geno!\nThe two gladly gave a dance number people requested for. Afterwards, the pair mingled with the crowd where the latter grab the chance to take photos with them.\nThe reunion was also the first public appearance in many years for the faces of Sustagen Milk in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, who disappeared from the public eye, only to re-emerge two decades later, starting with Susy\u2019s return last February. Only then would we find out that she and Geno had actually lost touch through the years.\nMeanwhile, Susy and Geno\u2019s friends from Sustagen also did their part, providing free milk for all guests and fans.\nIt was a lovely day for Susy and Geno and for their loyal supporters. I\u2019m sure happy memories came to you as you watched them reunited."}

In vitro whole cell recordings have been used here to investigate postsynaptic signalling mechanisms that mediate the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in layer II entorhinal cortex cells. To induce LTD, pairs of pulses, using a 30-millisecond interval, were delivered at 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, consistent with a requirement for calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Induction of LTD was blocked when the FK506 was included in the intracellular solution to block the phosphatase calcineurin. Okadaic acid, which blocks activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, also prevented LTD. Activation of protein phosphatases following calcium influx therefore contributes to induction of LTD in layer II of the entorhinal cortex.\nto the cognitive functions of the parahippocampal region.\nineffective in adult slices [21\u201323] and in intact animals ([31, 32], see also ).\n[28, 29] but is not effective in vivo  or in slices from older animals .\nhippocampus leads to LTD in entorhinal cortex .\nand their proteosome-mediated degradation .\ncontrast optics, and an infrared video camera (Cohu, 4990 series, San Diego, Calif, USA).\ndid not receive conditioning stimulation.\nthe last 5 minutes of the recording period.\nalso similar for recording conditions in which significant LTD was obtained (71.2\u00b15.6% in 14 stellate and 76.8\u00b17.6% in 6 pyramidal cells).\nmoderate LTD of field potentials in a gas-fluid interface recording chamber .\nand remained at 99.6\u00b12.6% of baseline levels at the end of the recording period (Figures 1(b2), 1(c)).\nneuron that received low-frequency stimulation (b1) and in a control cell (b2).
