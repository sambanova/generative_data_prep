{"prompt": "", "completion": "Sony\u2019s first 3D TV is finally here, in the 40in shape of the KDL-40HX803. And to be honest, we\u2019re not expecting very much. For whenever we\u2019ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven\u2019t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let\u2019s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!\nRather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t wear Sony\u2019s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.\nIt doesn\u2019t do the 40HX803\u2018s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it\u2019s nothing like as slim as Samsung\u2019s edge LED icons. What\u2019s more, its edge LED system is a dynamic one, meaning that sections of the edge lighting can be independently controlled for a hopefully more impressive contrast performance than you usually get with a standard edge LED-lit LCD TV.\nSlightly surprisingly for such a slim screen, Sony has left most of its connections facing straight out of the TV\u2019s rear, rather than using the side access approach that would suit wall hanging. But at least the number and variety of these connections is pretty prodigious.\nFor instance, it has four HDMIs, all built to the v1.4 specification, so that they\u2019re compatible with 3D sources. Also of note are a USB input, an Ethernet port, and a 3D Sync terminal, which we\u2019ll look at in turn.\nThe USB can play music, video and photo files directly into the TV, but also allows you to add Wi-Fi to the 40HX803 via an optional USB dongle. It\u2019s a touch disappointing that the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t carry built-in Wi-Fi for its money, but it\u2019s hardly alone in preferring the optional upgrade route.\nThe Ethernet socket, meanwhile, has three uses. First, it supports the set\u2019s built-in Freeview HD tuner, to deliver potential future interactive services like the BBC iPlayer. Second, it provides a wired means of importing files stored on a DLNA PC. Finally, it allows you to take the TV online to experience Sony\u2019s Bravia Internet Video platform, which we\u2019ll return to in a minute.\nBut first we\u2019ve got to discuss the 3D Sync terminal. This is there because the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have a built-in 3D transmitter, unlike the Samsung and Panasonic 3D TVs we\u2019ve tested. In fact, the 40HX803 doesn\u2019t have 3D facilities at all in its standard form. You have to add an optional extra transmitter and optional pairs of active shutter glasses, with the transmitter costing \u00a350 and the glasses setting you back \u00a399 per pair. This effectively makes the 40HX803 \u00a31,887 if you want 3D with two pairs of glasses.\nWe do understand Sony\u2019s idea with this, to be fair. For it helps keep the 40HX803\u2019s up-front price down, allowing people to add 3D later as their finances allow. But there\u2019s no getting round the fact that once you\u2019ve 3Ded it up, the 40HX803 hits a similar price level to Samsung\u2019s 40C8000 integrated 3D TV. In other words, 3D continues to be very much a premium technology."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "Recently, I sat down to talk with a group of eight students from a large prominent church in Southern California. They were raised in the church. They were regulars at youth group. They claimed to be in relationship with Christ. Yet, they were dead. As I tried to engage them, most seemed unmoved and uninterested. And I was not surprised.\nAs I work with churches around the country, I encounter countless Christian students who are apathetic toward spiritual things. Their relationship with Christ is passionless. Talk of God is ho-hum. But why? Shouldn\u2019t our relationship with Christ be life\u2019s most exciting adventure? I\u2019m not suggesting the Christian life is one, big, emotional high, but why are students more willing to plug into their iPods than their Bibles? Why are they more excited about the latest celebrity gossip than the Gospel? Why aren\u2019t their lives filled with the drama of God\u2019s Kingdom?\nI think a big part of the problem is that Christian students rarely engage their world for the cause of Christ. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed in my training over the years. The most exciting events I do, the events where students seem to come to life, are those where there is some component of engagement. Let me illustrate.\nFor almost ten years now, I\u2019ve been taking students on mission trips to Berkeley and Utah. Each trip requires hours of training, typically in the form of classroom instruction and the reading of required books. This training is important and necessary, but it\u2019s not what generates the most buzz among the students. Students get fired up on the trip when we give them opportunities to engage non-believers.\nOn these trips we invite Mormon leaders, Unitarians, gay activists, Hare Krishna priests, skeptics, and atheists to dialogue with students. We give our non-Christian guests time to share their views, followed by a time of questions from our students. It\u2019s during Q&A when students really come to life. They ask question after question, graciously yet firmly force our skeptical guests to give a reason for their views. At the conclusion of each encounter, we thank our guests and then spend time debriefing. At this point, students are always abuzz, asking me question after question. Before I know it, an hour of discussing apologetics and theology with youth will have flown by.\nIn addition, we send our groups onto college campuses, like BYU or Berkeley, to conduct surveys. The surveys are designed to get our students into conversation with non-Christians students about spiritual issues. At first, students are fearful and anxious. They\u2019re skeptical about people\u2019s willingness to engage with them. But after an hour or two of surveys, students return and they are always pumped. During our debrief time, students can\u2019t wait to share about their encounters. They\u2019re filled with excitement about their conversations on campus with non-Christians.\nWhen we create opportunities for students to engage, there is a vibrancy that infuses the events. But this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Christianity is not a spectator sport. Our teaching should not remain in a classroom or behind the four walls of the church. If we want to train students who can defend the faith not just intelligently but passionately, we need to get them in the game. Think about any sports teams. It\u2019s the starters who are the most passionate about the game, right? The benchwarmers, not so much. I think that\u2019s one reason why our mission trips to Berkeley and Utah are exciting and successful. They get students in the game. They get students engaging a lost world with the truth of Jesus Christ.\nIn 2014, students will get a taste of being in the game as I take them to Berkeley and Utah. I\u2019ve already maxed out the number of mission trips I\u2019m capable of taking through July. Indeed, we\u2019ve had to turn groups away or ask them to start scheduling for 2015. So this year, we\u2019ll be getting students off the sidelines and igniting their fire for Christ. I can\u2019t wait."}

Our systems have a lifetime expectancy of more than 25 years.\nMost cost and energy efficient systemOperating efficiency of our systems can exceed 97%, because they do not require power conversion in the power path or a conditioned, energy consuming battery room during operation. You also do not need battery replacement every 3 to 5 years, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to for example static UPS technologies.\nMost environmental friendly systemOur rotary systems have high energy efficiency and do not use batteries. Static UPS systems for example produce a considerable amount of chemical waste during its lifetime, because batteries need to be replaced every 3 to 5 years. Click here to find out more about the environmental benefits of our systems.\nMost space efficient systemA static UPS system requires a diesel generator set, power electronics, batteries and numerous auxiliary equipment. Our compact and simple diesel rotary UPS design combines all these components in one, reducing the footprint with 40 up to 60%."}
