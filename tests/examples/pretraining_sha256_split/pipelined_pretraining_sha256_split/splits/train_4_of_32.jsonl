{"prompt": "", "completion": "The bantamweight champion of DEEP, Takafumi Otsuka, will take on Koichi Ishiuzka on May 13th at Differ Ariake in Tokyo.\nOtsuka was supposed to fight Fernando Vieira for the WSOF-GC bantamweight title in December. However, the Brazilian was over the weight at the first weigh-in and never showed up at the second weigh-in. Vieira was nowhere to be found after this.The Brazilian basically fled from the entire show.\nOtsuka became the inaugural WSOF-GC champ but this means, the last time he fought was back in August of last year. That was, however, against a Mongolian fighter named Baataryn Azjavkhlan who was 1-0 at the time.\nIn terms of competitive fight, vs Daisuke Engo in February 2016 maybe is the last time Otsuka went through, which is more than a year ago.\nIshizuka is basically born and raised in DEEP.\nAnd, he is undefeated in the last ten fights.\nFor Ishizuka, this must be the opportunity he has been looking for all of his pro MMA career.\nSo, Ishizuka has to be motivated than ever.\nThe only concern is, his recent changes in the training environment. In last year, Ishizuka moved to Aichi because of the job which forced him to leave team Brightness Monma. And, Ishizuka joined team ALIVE which is based in Aichi prefecture.\nBesides this title fight between Otsuka and Ishizuka, men\u2019s strawweight bout between Haruo Ochi and \u201cRambo\u201d Kosuke is also confirmed.\nThese two met all the way back in May of 2011.\nThis fight took place in Shooto.\n\u201cRambo\u201d almost caught Ochi with an armbar in the first round. But Ochi came back and KO\u2019d Kosuke in the second round. That was \u201cRambo\u201d\u2018s first pro defeat in seven fights."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "When Rudy Gay left the game with a left knee injury late in the first quarter, memories of the Sacramento Kings\u2019 (16-22) recent poor play minus a star resurfaced. The thought came to fruition as DeMarcus Cousins joined him on the sidelines in the waning seconds of regulation, and the short-handed Kings fell to the visiting Dallas Mavericks (27-12), 108-104.\nThe Kings are currently 2-2 on their six-game home stand and return to action on Friday in a contest against the Miami Heat. Join Cowbell Kingdom\u2019sJames Ham as he recaps the action from the floor of Sleep Train Arena.\n1. Can the Kings win without DeMarcus Cousins?\nThe Kings are 0-7 without their starting center and it looks like Cousins will miss another game on Wednesday with a strained left hip flexor. Andrew Bogut is questionable for the Warrior with left shoulder inflammation, as is reserve Jermaine O\u2019Neal (sore back). This game might turn into a track meet, which doesn\u2019t bode well for Sacramento.\n2. Can the Kings defend the 3-point line?\nSacramento ranks 28th in the league against the long ball. The Warriors starting backcourt of Curry and Thompson have already shot close to 800 3-pointers on the season. If the Kings don\u2019t stay with Golden State\u2019s shooters, they have very little chance of pulling off the upset.\n3. How do the Kings players handle the trade rumors?\nThe trade deadline is 12pm PST on Thursday and the rumors are swirling. Do the Kings players crumble under the pressure or do they come out swinging in what might be their last game in Sacramento?\nAccording to an NBA source, Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas underwent an MRI earlier Tuesday on his left wrist. Counter to other media reports, the results of the tests were negative and Thomas is not expected to miss any time with the injury.\nSince taking over the starting position 35 games ago, Thomas is averaging 21.5 points, 6.9 assists and 1.3 steals per game in 37.5 minutes. But rumors that he was having some discomfort in his wrist began a few weeks back.\nRecently, his shooting numbers have taken a dramatic dip, beginning in January when he shot just 41.2 percent from the field and 32.7 percent from long range. Thomas\u2019s overall field goal percentage has bounced back in the month of February, but his 3-point percentage for the seven games this month is 24.1 percent.\nThomas and rookie guard Ben McLemore were the subject of a trade rumor on Monday, but coach Michael Malone and general manager Pete D\u2019Alessandro refuted the reports following practice on Tuesday afternoon.\nWith injuries and possible trade rumors swirling, it should be a wild couple of days in Sacramento.\nThomas wasn\u2019t the only Kings player to undergo an MRI today. For the second straight day, center DeMarcus Cousins made a trip to the doctors office for testing. Results of the first MRI were inconclusive, but a second test confirmed the Kings medical staff\u2019s earlier diagnosis of a strained left hip flexor.\nCousins has been unable to participate in practice since returning from the All-Star break. He is listed as day-to-day, but considered doubtful for Wednesday\u2019s match-up against the Golden State Warriors.\nHamady Ndiaye out of Rutgers and DeQuan Jones out of Florida are the only late additions. Ndiaye was in camp last season with Sacramento and left a solid impression. After being waived by the Kings, the 26-year old center spent last season playing for Tianjin Ronggang Golden Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association.\nJones played in 63 games last season with the Orlando Magic, including 17 starts. He averaged 3.7 points per game in a little under 13 minutes a game.\nLast season it was high ropes courses in Colorado Springs, Co. This year, the Sacramento Kings open training camp away from home again, but instead of the Team USA practice facility in Colorado, it will be on the sandy beaches of Santa Barbara, CA. Camp will run from Oct. 1-6 at the Pavilion Gym on the University of California, Santa Barbara campus.\nThe team will head back to Northern California for their pre-season opener on the road against the Golden State Warriors on October 7, before heading to Las Vegas to take on the Lakers on Oct. 10.\nAfter the initial week away, the Kings will continue camp in Sacramento at the team\u2019s practice facility in Natomas.\nCowbell Kingdom has grown exponentially since its founding in 2009 and we want to make sure we know our audience.

However, those who follow the Kings closely know just how valuable Thornton is, especially his competition.\n\u201cHe\u2019s become an outstanding scorer in this league,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks guard Darren Collisonback in January of his former New Orleans Hornets teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely made a niche in this league as far as (being) a big time scorer.\nIn their rookie year, Collison and Thornton formed an explosive and exciting young backcourt for the Hornets. Though they\u2019ve since gone their separate ways, the two remain close. Thornton worked out last offseason with Collison in Los Angeles during the lockout.\nThe fourth-year guard out of UCLA thinks Sacramento is a good fit for his old teammate. He believes Thornton will only continue to improve with the Kings\u2019 green nucleus.\nAveraging 18.7 points per game, Thornton led the Kings in scoring last season and usually found himself as their go-to-guy in clutch situations. The next step for Thornton, according to another former teammate, is becoming an accomplished defender.\nAs explosive as he is with the ball, Thornton could stand to see some improvement on the defensive end. The Louisiana native finished in the bottom three among his 15 teammates in defensive rating.\nHowever like Collison, West thinks Thornton will continue to find success in the league.\nThe Kings may not belong to Marcus Thornton. But his importance to their success isn\u2019t an understatement.\nTwenty-five years ago today, Sacramento Kings Head Coach Keith Smart hit a shot that changed his life forever.\nNo matter where I go, people talk about it. Once they recognize me or see a nametag on my bag or something like that, they start talking about \u201cThe Shot\u201d. So it\u2019s a great moment and I\u2019m glad it went in, but wasn\u2019t just something for me.\nWe just had our 25 year championship reunion. And we all got together and it wasn\u2019t so much what we all did in the tournament and our careers. It was a friendship and a relationship that we have now that that moment brings us all together.\nDiehard Sacramento Kings fan Kevin Fippin wanted to propose to his long-time girlfriend Lydia Nicolaisen. So before he popped the question on New Year\u2019s Eve, he recruited the services of a Sacramento Kings fan favorite."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "After last weeks episode, I was really curious what they had in store for us this week. How the heroes will come back to Earth after such a traumatic experience. And good thing for us, this episode is rightly named \u201cThe Aftermath of Hero Killer: Stain\u201d.\nWe open with Izuku, Iida, and Todoroki all in the hospital. They are all recovering from their tremendous fight. But also reflecting how lucky they are to be alive still. The door opens and we see Gran Torino and Pro Hero Manual. First thing Gran Torino does of course is scold Midoriya. But before Gran Torino goes full instructor on him, he tells the boys that they have a visitor.\nA tall figure turns the corner wearing a professional business suit. It\u2019s Hosu\u2019s chief of police, Kenji Tsuragamae. Who also happens to look like a dog (just go along with it I guess?). Kenji tells the boys that Stain is in custody and is being treated for several broken bones and serious burns. He also reminds them that what they have done was not okay on paper. Uncertified heroes using their Quirks against their instructors orders is highly frowned upon. But Todoroki is not taking it. He tells the chief that if Iida didn\u2019t step in, then Pro Hero Native would have been killed. And the both of them would have been killed without Izuku\u2019s help. But Gran Torino tells Todoroki to hear the chief out.\nKenji tells them that the punishment would only happen if this was made public. And the people would applaud their efforts anyway. But if the police kept it quiet, no one gets punished, but the boys don\u2019t get the praise they deserve. Instead Endeavor will get the praise from the masses. It would also explain Stain\u2019s burn scars. So they choose to not be celebrated as heroes and apologize anyways. But Kenji tells them he respects what they did and he thanks them for protecting the peace.\nSo it has hit the news that Endeavor has stopped hero killer Stain and the nomus from destroying Hosu City. It\u2019s all anyone is talking about. Meanwhile, we get a look at how everyone else from Class 1-A is doing in their internship programs. First we look at Bakugo who is having a less than stellar time. The first thing he wants to do is go knock some heads around but his mentor is not allowing him and says it will be business as usual. Hopefully that could help Bakugo control his temper. Kirishima finds out the reason why Midoriya sent him his location. Apparently he also reported the incident last night. Go Kirishima! Momo debuted in a commercial with her mentor and it seems obvious modelling is not what she wants to be doing. But her mentor is letting her go on patrol like she has wanted since the start of their training together.\nAnd finally there is Uraraka who is on the phone with Midoriya. She tells him how glad she is that they are all safe. Midoriya of course apologizes for not contacting sooner but she understands. In the midst of the conversation, Uraraka\u2019s mentor Gunhead reminds her that they are going to start their basic training. She then says bye to Midoriya and Gunhead asks in a very cute way, \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d. And she immediately dismisses it. When Midoriya hangs up he gets all worked up that he talked to a girl on the phone. This scene was my favorite from this episode it had me busting up!\nWe get back to the guys in the hospital and Iida comes out and tells the two that he may have long-term damage in his hand. But he reflects on his actions from that night and regrets them greatly. He shouldn\u2019t have acted so swiftly and carelessly. But Midoriya doesn\u2019t let Iida beat himself up too much. He agrees that him and Iida should get stronger together.\nWe cut to U.A. with All Might in the staff room. He gets a phone call from Gran Torino. He tells All Might that he has had his teaching licence revoked for six months because of Midoriya\u2019s actions but there was no way of avoiding that and that he has come to terms with it. But All Might is very ashamed of himself for letting down his former instructor. But this isn\u2019t the reason Gran Torino called. He really wants to talk about Stain. He says in the few minutes he was with him, it had him trembling. It was because of how intimidating and obsessed he was on what he think a hero should be and what he will do to correct our society. Because this has hit so many news stations, Stains ideology and opinions will be put on blast. People will become influenced by Stain\u2019s beliefs and become a plague. But All Might doesn\u2019t believe it will be a problem because they will probably show up sporadically and they will be taken out 1 by 1. But this is where the League of Villains comes in. If they all combine their hatred and Shigaraki gives them an outlet to express and deal with their evil intentions, it will become a serious problem. Gran Torino then reminds All Might that he must tell Midoriya properly what is concerning him and One for All. Which I have no idea what that is all about. Apparently the quirk is \u201con the move\u201d? I\u2019m interested in what that might mean.\nThis episode was mostly a lot of dialogue and context but it was needed after such a shift in the story. It was refreshing getting some insight on how everyone else is doing too. I\u2019m hoping next time they elaborate on what is concerning All Might and what is happening with his quirk? Only time will tell."}
