{"prompt": "", "completion": "2019 is here, and the new year provides an excellent opportunity to refresh your e-commerce website, by adding new features and updating content.\nWeb banners are a great way to keep your e-commerce website homepage looking fresh, and making viewers aware of the latest news about products and offers. They can be easily modified to serve a range of purposes, are potentially eye-catching if they are placed in the appropriate area and are a good way of promoting a specific product or offer on a homepage while also retaining the core brand visuals elsewhere.\nThe image below is an example of a web banner in development. We\u2019ve put together a handy guide for creating your banners \u2013 click here.\nNew features on your e-commerce website can add value through improved functionality, which in turn enhances the usability for customers and users. Features that allow for easy modification to products that they wish to purchase, such as different colours or quantities, or a social login function that enables users to create an account through their Facebook credentials.\nSuch responsive features make the e-commerce process as painless and easy-to-use as possible, limiting the barriers between browsing and purchase, in turn improving conversion rates and the chances of customers returning for more in the future.\nA positive experience can often leave the customer wanting more, and it\u2019s the websites job to ensure that their features and functionality are kept updated and fit for purpose, in response to the ever-changing demands of the modern e-commerce customer.\nFor example, one of the new features we\u2019ve recently added from Amasty is the Social Login, which allows users to set up their account using login credentials from Facebook. To find out more about this feature, click here.\nWhile you\u2019re reading this, grab a smartphone or tablet and have a browse around your website.\nAre the images stacked or overlapping, or is there text missing?\nThese issues mean your website has not been optimised for mobile devices, making it unusable for a large percentage of potential customers browsing with their iPhones or Samsungs. Users are extremely unlikely to want to fight through images and texts to find the products they want, and will quickly become frustrated and depart for a different site.\nDon\u2019t neglect these customers! Get your site optimised for different devices to reach as wide an audience as possible.\nData from 2018, shown below in the graph, from Statista.com, shows that 52.2% of all browsing online was done on a mobile device, a trend which has grown exponentially year-upon-year. This graph underlines the importance of ensuring that your website is fit for use for all potential users. You\u2019re potentially missing out on reaching these customers if your site doesn\u2019t meet their demands, and, with the trend of mobile browsing only set to rise, optimising your website to ensure it\u2019s fit for use is quickly become a necessity for online retailers.\nOur Liquidshop e-commerce platform is designed to provide the best user experience for your customers, though responsive e-commerce. Optimisation on devices of all sizes allows your website to be user-friendly for as many potential visitors as possible, expanding your reach and enhancing the user experience, leading to increased sales as part of the smooth and responsive overall e-commerce experience.\nThere are few things more off-putting when navigating onto an e-commerce website that a poorly designed logo at the top of the page, or old, pixilated imagery taking up the homepage. A consistent brand image across the pages improves brand recognition for customers and gives the impression of a modern, well designed and cared for website and business as a whole.\nYou can also create special themed logos for holiday times such as Christmas or winter, like we did with our logo below.\nWhat\u2019s most important is too put time and effort into keeping your website updated. Whether that\u2019s imagery, information or branding, putting the time into maintaining an attractive and cohesive e-commerce site means you keep your customers, and new visitors engaged and ensure that there as few barriers as possible between browsing and purchase."}

However the single and double-slit experiment and other experiments show that some effects of wave and particle can be measured in one measurement.\nWhen for example measuring a photon using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second beam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted. The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler\u2019s famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object.\nand the no-cloning theorem is about pure states..\nBut an ensemble of particles in a neuron would make it a mixed state..\nThe no-cloning theorem is normally stated and proven for pure states; the no-broadcast theorem generalizes this result to mixed states.\nApparently, worrying about measuring both position and momentum works differently for particles than it does waves.\nIt may actually be possible using phase.\nBohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.\nAnd \"quadratures\" is about position and momentum..\nWhich are apparently always orthogonal to each other.\nThere is obviously something to all of this.\nCounterfactual Communication was recently used to transmit information without sending any PARTICLES.\nthe information was sent in the phase.. of a wavefunction?\nand it used MachZenhder Interferometry..\nwhich is part of Quantum Metrology and its ability to harness non-classical states..\nand all of this can teleport non-classical light..\nand it all uses ANCILLAS... which store VALUES, and WAVEFUNCTIONS.. because they are Qubits/ Nitrogen vacancies..\nand are used in WEAK MEASUREMENT... which was used to measure a wavefunction.. something most would argue is impossible.. because of the uncertainty principle..\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics can be said to involve the use of counterfactual definiteness if it includes in the statistical population of measurement results, any measurements that are counterfactual because they are excluded by the quantum mechanical impossibility of simultaneous measurement of conjugate pairs of properties.\nand its the Ancillas that store values.. and may or may not be part of the measurement apparatus... / interferometer..\nThe quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways but the common apparatus considered to date features a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer. The quantum computer is set in a superposition of \"not running\" and \"running\" states by means such as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Those state histories are quantum interfered. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the \"not running\" state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. Measuring that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations such as Grover's algorithm even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer.\nwhich measured particles are \"cooled\" into for measurement techniques. a literal form of \"photon counting\"..\nlifetime of a few nanoseconds of the lowest vibrational level of the first excited state.\nDe-excitation from the excited singlet state to the ground state also occurs by other mechanisms, such as non-radiant thermal decay or \u2018phosphorescence\u2019. In the latter case, the chromophore undergoes a forbidden transition from the excited singlet state into the triplet state (intersystem crossing, ISC, Fig 2.4), which has a non-zero probability, for example because of spin orbit coupling of the electrons\u2019 magnetic moments\"\ndoing a search for Intersystem crossing, memristor brings up this link..\nA composite optical microcavity, in which nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond nanopillar are coupled to whispering gallery modes in a silica microsphere, is demonstrated. Nanopillars with a diameter as small as 200 nm are fabricated from a bulk diamond crystal by reactive ion etching and are positioned with nanometer precision near the equator of a silica microsphere. The composite nanopillar-microsphere system overcomes the poor controllability of a nanocrystal-based microcavity system and takes full advantage of the exceptional spin properties of NV centers and the ultrahigh quality factor of silica microspheres.\ncharacteristic form of I/V curves of manufactured devices.\nor  even with a simple linear drift of w.\nis the integral of voltage v(t) over time: \u03c6 = R v(t) dt.\nwhich must become the GROUND STATE of the ANCILLA upon non-classical correlation..\nWe investigate theoretically how the spectroscopy of an ancillary qubit can probe cavity (circuit) QED ground states containing photons. We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.\n(Quantum) back action refers (in the regime of Quantum systems) to the effect of a detector on the measurement itself, as if the detector is not just making the measurement but also affecting the measured or observed system under a perturbing effect.\nBack action has important consequences on the measurement process and is a significant factor in measurements near the quantum limit, such as measurements approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL).\nWhen performing continuous measurements of position with sensitivity approaching quantum mechanical limits, one must confront the fundamental effects of detector back-action.Back-action forces are responsible for the ultimate limit on continuous position detection, can also be harnessed to cool the observed structure[1,2,3,4], and are expected to generate quantum entanglement.\nthen those same wavefunctions are transfered and produce a correlation at the ground state..\nwhere the ancilla takes on the new value/wavefunction.. and here we find all these ideas..\nand it may just BE the network and its computing speed, that even allows the wavefunction to be \"found\"\nWhile there are lots of things that artificial intelligence can't do yet\u2014science being one of them\u2014neural networks are proving themselves increasingly adept at a huge variety of pattern recognition ... That's due in part to the description of a quantum system called its wavefunction. ...
