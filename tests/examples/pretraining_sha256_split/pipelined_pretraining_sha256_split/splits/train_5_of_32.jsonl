{"prompt": "", "completion": "A VISUALLY STUNNING architectural biography of Minnesota\u2019s most influential architect of the twentieth century. Architect, artist, furniture designer, and educator, Ralph Rapson has played a leading role in the development and practice of modern architecture and design, both nationally and internationally.\nRalph Rapson: Sixty Years of Modern Design, by Rip Rapson, Jane King Hession and Bruce N. Wright, documents the architect\u2019s vast career and uncanny associations.\nRapson believed design should be reflect the moment\u2013furniture, houses, cities\u2013but his take on modernism was never pompous. He perpetuated endless ideas\u2013still fresh\u2013vibrant drawings and youthful pranks. (He had his students hoist famous visitors upside down, including the stocky Buckminister Fuller, and footprint the ceiling with their bare soles.) The book shows how one can be talented, influential and happy, all the while remaining internationally obscure. It also tells, discreetly, how one man can achieve all this single-handedly: with his right forearm amputated at birth, Ralph Rapson drew with his left hand."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "The valley terrain is all covered with rock formations and intricate labyrinths created by nature. In ancient times, there were deposits of quartz. But the noisy river San Miguel has streamed lots of passages over the years.\nNow, quartz rocks hang over the pond and the holes of different shapes remind those seen on the moon. Due to the different degrees of refraction of light water in some places seems to be dark blue, in other - clear and transparent. Dark brown and almost black, sometimes bluish-gray rocks vary in height and shape.\nSuch miracle undoubtedly shows that the forces of nature are capable of creating the most unusual landscapes. In Brazil, Vale de Lua unusual relief appeared also due to the presence of sand. Gradually, layer after layer, it was brought there with river\u2019s stream, settled on the coastal cliffs and formed numerous mounds an unusual shape.\nIf looking a little closer you will notice that in some places the quartz rock thinned to such an extent that its thickness does not exceed the thickness of a sheet of paper. The magnificent landscape of small lakes is completed with waterfalls."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "My new global trends book is out now: The Future of Almost Everything. But it takes at least 20 years to evaluate how good a trends analyst was / is \u2013 so what about forecasts made by me in previous books, about what to expect over the following decade or two or three? How did those forecasts measure up? I had to answer that question for myself by re-reading what I wrote in the past about the future, before writing my latest book. Read FREE SAMPLE of The Truth about Almost Everything.\nSo you can judge for yourself, here are loads of predictions I made in the past - and the book in which they were made plus date. Every one of these is already a reality or looks like it soon could be, as of August 2015....And yes I got some things wrong - not many fortunately. I am going to publish the entire text of Futurewise 1998 edition on this website for a complete picture - but of course on this site already are hundreds of posts and videos going back in some cases over 20 years.\nHere's one I got wrong: I thought video streaming would take off - but with more use of live video using smartphones that we have actually seen. Most personal video streaming is of course things like YouTube clips.\nMost forecasting errors in my experience are not over WHAT is going to happen as the trend is usually fairly obvious, but by WHEN with questions about real impact. So here goes: how did I see the future of banking, global economy, mobile, smartphones, Internet of Things, Big Data and so on...?\nUK home ownership will prove a good long term investment, despite market collapse and many pundits claiming the end of the sector as a sound investment.
