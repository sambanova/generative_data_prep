{"prompt": "", "completion": "Archaeologists have found arrowheads and drills, indicating that the camps were occupied for extended periods of time.\nAn ancient campsite where people were manufacturing tools has been discovered near the Niagara Falls.\nThis find, combined with other archaeological discoveries in the area over the past few decades, suggests that such campsites lined the Niagara River as far back as 4,000 years ago.\n\"I would anticipate that there would have been, back in the day, these kinds of campsites all along the Niagara River on both sides and on both sides of the island,\" team leader Lisa Anselmi, of Buffalo State University of New York, told LiveScience.\nThe archaeologists found that people at the Grand Island site were making a wide variety of tools, including spear points, arrowheads and even a few stone drills. Anselmi said that the drills \"would be sharp enough to go through a piece of leather... or go through shell or some bone to create a bead.\"\nThe team also found bits of yellow and red ochre at the site; in ancient times it was common, for religious reasons, for ochre to be applied on the skin of someone who was being buried. No evidence of burials has been found so far at the site.\nThe south tip of Grand Island appears to have been occupied for an extended time.\nFragments of pottery dating between 2,900 and 1,500 years ago found by Anselmi and her colleagues suggest inhabitants experimented with ceramic production, using pots to collect nuts and plant remains.\nThe team also found spear points that date back around 500 years, to a period shortly before Europeans started arriving in the area. More recent artifacts included nails from houses built in the 19th century and bullets that appear to date to the 1930s or 40s.\nAnselmi said that the site probably would have been used mainly between the spring and fall, when food would have been plentiful. \"The island would have had the advantage of being close to the river (with) lots of freshwater fish and other kinds of resources from the river,\" she said. Also, \"in all likelihood there would have been a very strong deer population on the island.\"\nTo get to Grand Island people in antiquity would have had to cross the Niagara River. Today, the fast-flowing waterway moves at a rate of about 2-3 feet per second near the island.\nCuriously, rather than making use of rock found on the island, the ancient people imported a type of Onondaga chert \u2014 a tough limestone that they would have had to carry across the river from the mainland.\nAnselmi explained that they would have brought over small bits of this rock that could then be molded into tools. \"It's not necessarily that they're filling a canoe up with boulders,\" she said.\nBy using Onondaga chert the people of Grand Island were continuing a toolmaking tradition that goes back to when people were first entering New York State.\nFor instance, at a site called Emanon Pond, located in western New York, people were using the material almost exclusively nearly 11,000 years ago.\n\"With the exception of a single projectile point made from glacially derived drusy quartz, all of the artifacts are manufactured using local Onondaga chert,\" write Peter Neal Peregrine and Melvin Ember in the North America edition of the \"Encyclopedia of Prehistory,\" published in 2001.\nThe findings were presented in May at a meeting of the Toronto chapter of the Ontario Archaeological Society."}

In such supranational union that is neither a pure intergovernmental organization nor a true federal state, political institutions appear vague and somewhat obscure and indistinguishable.\nAre Iran and Saudi Arabia going to war? They are already fighting \u2013 by proxy \u2013 all over the region. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran quickly deteriorated in January 2016 following Riyadh\u2019s execution of Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimi but their struggle for power dates back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. Tehran's influence extends today across a broad area of the Middle East from Iran in the east to Lebanon in the west.\nUNESCO\u2019s Director-General, Irina Bokova and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni signed in February 2016 in Rome an agreement on the establishment of a Task Force of cultural heritage experts in the framework of UNESCO\u2019s global coalition \u201cUnite for Heritage\u201d. Under the agreement, UNESCO will be able to ask the Italian Government to make experts of the Task Force available for deployment for the conservation of cultural heritage in areas affected by crises.\nIn October 2016 John Sawers, a former MI6 chief, told BBC that the world was entering an era possibly \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the Cold War, as \u201cwe do not have that focus on a strategic relationship between Moscow and Washington\u201d.\nLt. Gen. Eugeny Buzhinsky, head of PIR Centre, a Moscow Think Tank, did maintain: \u201cIf we talk about the last Cold War, we are currently somewhere between the erection of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis but without the mechanisms to manage the confrontation\u201d."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O Kuntze (Paran\u00e1 pine or Araucaria) is a potential forestry native species for Brazilian silviculture. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints persist, hindering its silvicultural expansion, among which are the lack of cloning technologies of superior genetic materials and their assessment under field conditions. Thus, we evaluated the potential use of araucaria plants derived from cuttings and seeds for timber production, by assessing field survival, growth and strobilus production using cuttings from male and female plants, collected from different positions, compared with those produced by sexual reproduction. Clones of male and female trees from different types of cuttings and seedlings were planted in 3 x 3 m spacing. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of one tree plot with three treatments. Female clones and apical cuttings showed higher growth in diameter at breast height (6.4 cm) and total height (3.6 m) 74 months after planting, followed by seedlings and other clones, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings technique is potential for araucaria propagation for wood production purposes, and it is favored by the use of apical cuttings from female mother trees."}
